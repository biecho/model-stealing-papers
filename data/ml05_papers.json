      "abstract": "Machine learning is being increasingly used by individuals, research institutions, and corporations. This has resulted in the surge of Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) - cloud services that provide (a) tools and resources to learn the model, and (b) a user-friendly query interface to access the model. However, such MLaaS systems raise privacy concerns such as model extraction. In model extraction attacks, adversaries maliciously exploit the query interface to steal the model. More precisely, in a model extraction attack, a good approximation of a sensitive or proprietary model held by the server is extracted (i.e. learned) by a dishonest user who interacts with the server only via the query interface. This attack was introduced by Tramer et al. at the 2016 USENIX Security Symposium, where practical attacks for various models were shown. We believe that better understanding the efficacy of model extraction attacks is paramount to designing secure MLaaS systems. To that end, we take the first step by (a) formalizing model extraction and discussing possible defense strategies, and (b) drawing parallels between model extraction and established area of active learning. In particular, we show that recent advancements in the active learning domain can be used to implement powerful model extraction attacks, and investigate possible defense strategies.",

      "abstract": "In a model extraction attack, an adversary steals a copy of a remotely deployed machine learning model, given oracle prediction access. We taxonomize model extraction attacks around two objectives: *accuracy*, i.e., performing well on the underlying learning task, and *fidelity*, i.e., matching the predictions of the remote victim classifier on any input.   To extract a high-accuracy model, we develop a learning-based attack exploiting the victim to supervise the training of an extracted model. Through analytical and empirical arguments, we then explain the inherent limitations that prevent any learning-based strategy from extracting a truly high-fidelity model---i.e., extracting a functionally-equivalent model whose predictions are identical to those of the victim model on all possible inputs. Addressing these limitations, we expand on prior work to develop the first practical functionally-equivalent extraction attack for direct extraction (i.e., without training) of a model's weights.   We perform experiments both on academic datasets and a state-of-the-art image classifier trained with 1 billion proprietary images. In addition to broadening the scope of model extraction research, our work demonstrates the practicality of model extraction attacks against production-grade systems.",

      "title": "Entangled Watermarks as a Defense against Model Extraction",
      "abstract": "Machine learning involves expensive data collection and training procedures. Model owners may be concerned that valuable intellectual property can be leaked if adversaries mount model extraction attacks. As it is difficult to defend against model extraction without sacrificing significant prediction accuracy, watermarking instead leverages unused model capacity to have the model overfit to outlier input-output pairs. Such pairs are watermarks, which are not sampled from the task distribution and are only known to the defender. The defender then demonstrates knowledge of the input-output pairs to claim ownership of the model at inference. The effectiveness of watermarks remains limited because they are distinct from the task distribution and can thus be easily removed through compression or other forms of knowledge transfer. \r\nWe introduce Entangled Watermarking Embeddings (EWE). Our approach encourages the model to learn features for classifying data that is sampled from the task distribution and data that encodes watermarks. An adversary attempting to remove watermarks that are entangled with legitimate data is also forced to sacrifice performance on legitimate data. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Speech Commands validate that the defender can claim model ownership with 95\\% confidence with less than 100 queries to the stolen copy, at a modest cost below 0.81 percentage points on average in the defended model's performance.",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained encoders are general-purpose feature extractors that can be used for many downstream tasks. Recent progress in self-supervised learning can pre-train highly effective encoders using a large volume of unlabeled data, leading to the emerging encoder as a service (EaaS). A pre-trained encoder may be deemed confidential because its training requires lots of data and computation resources as well as its public release may facilitate misuse of AI, e.g., for deepfakes generation. In this paper, we propose the first attack called StolenEncoder to steal pre-trained image encoders. We evaluate StolenEncoder on multiple target encoders pre-trained by ourselves and three real-world target encoders including the ImageNet encoder pre-trained by Google, CLIP encoder pre-trained by OpenAI, and Clarifai's General Embedding encoder deployed as a paid EaaS. Our results show that our stolen encoders have similar functionality with the target encoders. In particular, the downstream classifiers built upon a target encoder and a stolen one have similar accuracy. Moreover, stealing a target encoder using StolenEncoder requires much less data and computation resources than pre-training it from scratch. We also explore three defenses that perturb feature vectors produced by a target encoder. Our results show these defenses are not enough to mitigate StolenEncoder.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to model extraction attacks, where the adversary builds a substitute model that achieves almost the same performance of a black-box victim model simply via querying the victim model. To defend against such attacks, a series of methods have been proposed to disrupt the query results before returning them to potential attackers, greatly degrading the performance of existing model extraction attacks.In this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a defense-penetrating model extraction attack framework, named D-DAE, which aims to break disruption-based defenses. The linchpins of D-DAE are the design of two modules, i.e., disruption detection and disruption recovery, which can be integrated with generic model extraction attacks. More specifically, after obtaining query results from the victim model, the disruption detection module infers the defense mechanism adopted by the defender. We design a meta-learning-based disruption detection algorithm for learning the fundamental differences between the distributions of disrupted and undisrupted query results. The algorithm features a good generalization property even if we have no access to the original training dataset of the victim model. Given the detected defense mechanism, the disruption recovery module tries to restore a clean query result from the disrupted query result with well-designed generative models. Our extensive evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and ImageNette datasets demonstrate that D-DAE can enhance the substitute model accuracy of the existing model extraction attacks by as much as 82.24% in the face of 4 state-of-the-art defenses and combinations of multiple defenses. We also verify the effectiveness of D-DAE in penetrating unknown defenses in real-world APIs hosted by Microsoft Azure and Face++.",

      "abstract": "Copyright protection for deep neural networks (DNNs) is an urgent need for AI corporations. To trace illegally distributed model copies, DNN watermarking is an emerging technique for embedding and verifying secret identity messages in the prediction behaviors or the model internals. Sacrificing less functionality and involving more knowledge about the target DNN, the latter branch called \\textit{white-box DNN watermarking} is believed to be accurate, credible and secure against most known watermark removal attacks, with emerging research efforts in both the academy and the industry. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on how the mainstream white-box DNN watermarks are commonly vulnerable to neural structural obfuscation with \\textit{dummy neurons}, a group of neurons which can be added to a target model but leave the model behavior invariant. Devising a comprehensive framework to automatically generate and inject dummy neurons with high stealthiness, our novel attack intensively modifies the architecture of the target model to inhibit the success of watermark verification. With extensive evaluation, our work for the first time shows that nine published watermarking schemes require amendments to their verification procedures.",

      "abstract": "Recently, numerous highly-valuable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been trained using deep learning algorithms. To protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of the original owners over such DNN models, backdoor-based watermarks have been extensively studied. However, most of such watermarks fail upon model extraction attack, which utilizes input samples to query the target model and obtains the corresponding outputs, thus training a substitute model using such input-output pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark to protect IP of DNN models against model extraction, named MEA-Defender. In particular, we obtain the watermark by combining two samples from two source classes in the input domain and design a watermark loss function that makes the output domain of the watermark within that of the main task samples. Since both the input domain and the output domain of our watermark are indispensable parts of those of the main task samples, the watermark will be extracted into the stolen model along with the main task during model extraction. We conduct extensive experiments on four model extraction attacks, using five datasets and six models trained based on supervised learning and self-supervised learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that MEA-Defender is highly robust against different model extraction attacks, and various watermark removal/detection approaches.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities of generating texts resembling human language. However, they can be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to address these concerns, which embeds a message (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by an LLM. By embedding the user ID (represented as a bit string) into generated texts, we can trace generated texts to the user, known as content source tracing. The major limitation of existing watermarking techniques is that they achieve sub-optimal performance for content source tracing in real-world scenarios. The reason is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract a long message from a generated text. We aim to address the limitations. In this work, we introduce a new watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in pseudo-random segment assignment. We also propose multiple techniques to further enhance the robustness of our watermarking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method. Our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets. For instance, when embedding a message of length 20 into a 200-token generated text, our method achieves a match rate of $97.6\\%$, while the state-of-the-art work Yoo et al. only achieves $49.2\\%$. Additionally, we prove that our watermark can tolerate edits within an edit distance of 17 on average for each paragraph under the same setting.",

      "abstract": "The great economic values of deep neural networks (DNNs) urge AI enterprises to protect their intellectual property (IP) for these models. Recently, proof-of-training (PoT) has been proposed as a promising solution to DNN IP protection, through which AI enterprises can utilize the record of DNN training process as their ownership proof. To prevent attackers from forging ownership proof, a secure PoT scheme should be able to distinguish honest training records from those forged by attackers. Although existing PoT schemes provide various distinction criteria, these criteria are based on intuitions or observations. The effectiveness of these criteria lacks clear and comprehensive analysis, resulting in existing schemes initially deemed secure being swiftly compromised by simple ideas. In this paper, we make the first move to identify distinction criteria in the style of formal methods, so that their effectiveness can be explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, we conduct systematic modeling to cover a wide range of attacks and then theoretically analyze the distinctions between honest and forged training records. The analysis results not only induce a universal distinction criterion, but also provide detailed reasoning to demonstrate its effectiveness in defending against attacks covered by our model. Guided by the criterion, we propose a generic PoT construction that can be instantiated into concrete schemes. This construction sheds light on the realization that trajectory matching algorithms, previously employed in data distillation, possess significant advantages in PoT construction. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can resist attacks that have compromised existing PoT schemes, which corroborates its superiority in security.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to 0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.",

      "abstract": "Training machine learning (ML) models typically involves expensive iterative optimization. Once the model's final parameters are released, there is currently no mechanism for the entity which trained the model to prove that these parameters were indeed the result of this optimization procedure. Such a mechanism would support security of ML applications in several ways. For instance, it would simplify ownership resolution when multiple parties contest ownership of a specific model. It would also facilitate the distributed training across untrusted workers where Byzantine workers might otherwise mount a denial-of-service by returning incorrect model updates.   In this paper, we remediate this problem by introducing the concept of proof-of-learning in ML. Inspired by research on both proof-of-work and verified computations, we observe how a seminal training algorithm, stochastic gradient descent, accumulates secret information due to its stochasticity. This produces a natural construction for a proof-of-learning which demonstrates that a party has expended the compute require to obtain a set of model parameters correctly. In particular, our analyses and experiments show that an adversary seeking to illegitimately manufacture a proof-of-learning needs to perform *at least* as much work than is needed for gradient descent itself.   We also instantiate a concrete proof-of-learning mechanism in both of the scenarios described above. In model ownership resolution, it protects the intellectual property of models released publicly. In distributed training, it preserves availability of the training procedure. Our empirical evaluation validates that our proof-of-learning mechanism is robust to variance induced by the hardware (ML accelerators) and software stacks.",

      "title": "SoK: How Robust is Image Classification Deep Neural Network Watermarking?",
      "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) watermarking is a method for provenance verification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark removal attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance verification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been proposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a relatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation of these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This uncertainty about a watermarking scheme's robustness causes difficulty to trust their deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently proposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large set of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are known removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated as removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth retraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes surveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and removal attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets of parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is robust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and known methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as removal attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently evaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a more extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model. Our source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly available, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.",

      "title": "Copy, Right? A Testing Framework for Copyright Protection of Deep Learning Models",
      "abstract": "Deep learning models, especially those large-scale and high-performance ones, can be very costly to train, demanding a considerable amount of data and computational resources. As a result, deep learning models have become one of the most valuable assets in modern artificial intelligence. Unauthorized duplication or reproduction of deep learning models can lead to copyright infringement and cause huge economic losses to model owners, calling for effective copyright protection techniques. Existing protection techniques are mostly based on watermarking, which embeds an owner-specified watermark into the model. While being able to provide exact ownership verification, these techniques are 1) invasive, i.e., they need to tamper with the training process, which may affect the model utility or introduce new security risks into the model; 2) prone to adaptive attacks that attempt to remove/replace the watermark or adversarially block the retrieval of the watermark; and 3) not robust to the emerging model extraction attacks. Latest fingerprinting work on deep learning models, though being non-invasive, also falls short when facing the diverse and ever-growing attack scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel testing framework for deep learning copyright protection: DEEPJUDGE. DEEPJUDGE quantitatively tests the similarities between two deep learning models: a victim model and a suspect model. It leverages a diverse set of testing metrics and efficient test case generation algorithms to produce a chain of supporting evidence to help determine whether a suspect model is a copy of the victim model. Advantages of DEEPJUDGE include: 1) non-invasive, as it works directly on the model and does not tamper with the training process; 2) efficient, as it only needs a small set of seed test cases and a quick scan of the two models; 3) flexible, i.e., it can easily incorporate new testing metrics or test case generation methods to obtain more confident and robust judgement; and 4) fairly robust to model extraction attacks and adaptive attacks. We verify the effectiveness of DEEPJUDGE under three typical copyright infringement scenarios, including model finetuning, pruning and extraction, via extensive experiments on both image classification and speech recognition datasets with a variety of model architectures.",

      "abstract": "On-device deep learning (DL) has rapidly gained adoption in mobile apps, offering the benefits of offline model inference and user privacy preservation over cloud-based approaches. However, it inevitably stores models on user devices, introducing new vulnerabilities, particularly model-stealing attacks and intellectual property infringement. While system-level protections like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide a robust solution, practical challenges remain in achieving scalable on-device DL model protection, including complexities in supporting third-party models and limited adoption in current mobile solutions. Advancements in TEE-enabled hardware, such as NVIDIA's GPU-based TEEs, may address these obstacles in the future. Currently, watermarking serves as a common defense against model theft but also faces challenges here as many mobile app developers lack corresponding machine learning expertise and the inherent read-only and inference-only nature of on-device DL models prevents third parties like app stores from implementing existing watermarking techniques in post-deployment models. To protect the intellectual property of on-device DL models, in this paper, we propose THEMIS, an automatic tool that lifts the read-only restriction of on-device DL models by reconstructing their writable counterparts and leverages the untrainable nature of on-device DL models to solve watermark parameters and protect the model owner's intellectual property. Extensive experimental results across various datasets and model structures show the superiority of THEMIS in terms of different metrics. Further, an empirical investigation of 403 real-world DL mobile apps from Google Play is performed with a success rate of 81.14%, showing the practicality of THEMIS.",

      "title": "PRSA: Prompt Stealing Attacks against Real-World Prompt Services",
      "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention for their exceptional capabilities. Prompts are central to the functionality and performance of LLMs, making them highly valuable assets. The increasing reliance on high-quality prompts has driven significant growth in prompt services. However, this growth also expands the potential for prompt leakage, increasing the risk that attackers could replicate original functionalities, create competing products, and severely infringe on developers' intellectual property. Despite these risks, prompt leakage in real-world prompt services remains underexplored. In this paper, we present PRSA, a practical attack framework designed for prompt stealing. PRSA infers the detailed intent of prompts through very limited input-output analysis and can successfully generate stolen prompts that replicate the original functionality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate PRSA's effectiveness across two main types of real-world prompt services. Specifically, compared to previous works, it improves the attack success rate from 17.8% to 46.1% in prompt marketplaces and from 39% to 52% in LLM application stores, respectively. Notably, in the attack on \"Math\", one of the most popular educational applications in OpenAI's GPT Store with over 1 million conversations, PRSA uncovered a hidden Easter egg that had not been revealed previously. Besides, our analysis reveals that higher mutual information between a prompt and its output correlates with an increased risk of leakage. This insight guides the design and evaluation of two potential defenses against the security threats posed by PRSA. We have reported these findings to the prompt service vendors, including PromptBase and OpenAI, and actively collaborate with them to implement defensive measures.",

      "title": "Prompt Obfuscation for Large Language Models",
      "abstract": "System prompts that include detailed instructions to describe the task performed by the underlying LLM can easily transform foundation models into tools and services with minimal overhead. They are often considered intellectual property, similar to the code of a software product, because of their crucial impact on the utility. However, extracting system prompts is easily possible. As of today, there is no effective countermeasure to prevent the stealing of system prompts, and all safeguarding efforts could be evaded. In this work, we propose an alternative to conventional system prompts. We introduce prompt obfuscation to prevent the extraction of the system prompt with little overhead. The core idea is to find a representation of the original system prompt that leads to the same functionality, while the obfuscated system prompt does not contain any information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the original system prompt. We evaluate our approach by comparing our obfuscated prompt output with the output of the original prompt, using eight distinct metrics to measure the lexical, character-level, and semantic similarity. We show that the obfuscated version is constantly on par with the original one. We further perform three different deobfuscation attacks with varying attacker knowledge--covering both black-box and white-box conditions--and show that in realistic attack scenarios an attacker is unable to extract meaningful information. Overall, we demonstrate that prompt obfuscation is an effective mechanism to safeguard the intellectual property of a system prompt while maintaining the same utility as the original prompt.",

With as few as 8 interactions, LLMmap can accurately identify 42 different LLM versions with over 95% accuracy. More importantly, LLMmap is designed to be robust across different application layers, allowing it to identify LLM versions--whether open-source or proprietary--from various vendors, operating under various unknown system prompts, stochastic sampling hyperparameters, and even complex generation frameworks such as RAG or Chain-of-Thought.
