      "abstract": "Shielding neural networks (NNs) from untrusted hosts with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) has been increasingly adopted. Nevertheless, this paper shows that the confidentiality of NNs and user data is compromised by the recently disclosed ciphertext side channels in TEEs, which leak memory write patterns of TEE-shielded NNs to malicious hosts. While recent works have used ciphertext side channels to recover cryptographic key bits, the technique does not apply to NN inputs which are more complex and only have partial information leaked. We propose an automated input recovery framework, CipherSteal, and for the first time demonstrate the severe threat of ciphertext side channels to NN inputs. CipherSteal novelly recasts the input recovery as a two-step approach \u2014 information transformation and reconstruction \u2014 and proposes optimizations to fully utilize partial input information leaked in ciphertext side channels. We evaluate CipherSteal on diverse NNs (e.g., Transformer) and image/video inputs, and successfully recover visually identical inputs under different levels of attacker's pre-knowledge towards the target NNs and their inputs. We comprehensively evaluate two popular NN frameworks, TensorFlow and PyTorch, and NN executables generated by two recent NN compilers, TVM and Glow, and study their different attack surfaces. Moreover, we further steal the target NN's functionality by training a surrogate NN with our recovered inputs, and also leverage the surrogate NN to generate \u201cwhite-box\u201d adversarial examples, effectively manipulating the target NN's predictions.",

      "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative learning paradigm where participants share the same sample space while splitting the feature space. In VFL, local participants host their bottom models for feature extraction and collaboratively train a classifier by exchanging intermediate results with the server owning the labels. Both local training data and bottom models contain privacy-sensitive information and are considered the intellectual property of each participant, and thus should be protected by the design of VFL. Our study exposes the fundamental susceptibility of VFL systems to privacy leaks, which arise from the collaboration between the server and clients during both training and testing. Based on our findings, we propose PISTE, a model-agnostic framework of privacy stealing attacks against VFL. PISTE delivers three privacy inference attacks, i.e., model stealing, data reconstruction, and property inference attacks on five benchmark datasets and four different model architectures. We further discuss four potential countermeasures. Experimental results show that all of them cannot prevent all three privacy stealing attacks in PISTE. In summary, our study demonstrates the inherent yet rarely uncovered vulnerability of VFL on leaking data and model privacy.",

      "abstract": "Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) threaten modern machine learning systems by enabling adversaries to steal models, exposing intellectual property and training data. With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in distributed computing environments, including cloud, edge, and federated learning settings, each paradigm introduces distinct vulnerabilities and challenges. Without a unified perspective on MEAs across these distributed environments, organizations risk fragmented defenses, inadequate risk assessments, and substantial economic and privacy losses. This survey is motivated by the urgent need to understand how the unique characteristics of cloud, edge, and federated deployments shape attack vectors and defense requirements. We systematically examine the evolution of attack methodologies and defense mechanisms across these environments, demonstrating how environmental factors influence security strategies in critical sectors such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and financial services. By synthesizing recent advances in MEAs research and discussing the limitations of current evaluation practices, this survey provides essential insights for developing robust and adaptive defense strategies. Our comprehensive approach highlights the importance of integrating protective measures across the entire distributed computing landscape to ensure the secure deployment of machine learning models.",

      "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach that adaptes pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to multi-tenant tasks by generating a variety of LoRA adapters. However, this approach faces significant security challenges and is particularly susceptible to malicious servers stealing model parameters and sensitive data. Existing research on addressing security risks in multi-tenant environments remains constrained and insufficient. This paper explores the security challenges and proposes the LoRATEE framework, which embeds LoRA adapters within a server-side Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and employs a lightweight One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption mechanism to ensure secure data transmission. Additionally, we design a dynamic LoRA adapter prefetching mechanism to reduce I/O latency. Moreover, a LoRA adapter module equivalence-sharing strategy based on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and minimalist design principles was introduced to optimize adapters loading. Experimental results show that LoRATEE maintains inference efficiency while securing multi-tenant LoRA LLMs systems.",

      "title": "HoneypotNet: Backdoor Attacks Against Model Extraction",
      "abstract": "Model extraction attacks are one type of inference-time attacks that approximate the functionality and performance of a black-box victim model by launching a certain number of queries to the model and then leveraging the model's predictions to train a substitute model. These attacks pose severe security threats to production models and MLaaS platforms and could cause significant monetary losses to the model owners. A body of work has proposed to defend machine learning models against model extraction attacks, including both active defense methods that modify the model's outputs or increase the query overhead to avoid extraction and passive defense methods that detect malicious queries or leverage watermarks to perform post-verification. In this work, we introduce a new defense paradigm called attack as defense which modifies the model's output to be poisonous such that any malicious users that attempt to use the output to train a substitute model will be poisoned. To this end, we propose a novel lightweight backdoor attack method dubbed HoneypotNet that replaces the classification layer of the victim model with a honeypot layer and then fine-tunes the honeypot layer with a shadow model (to simulate model extraction) via bi-level optimization to modify its output to be poisonous while remaining the original performance. We empirically demonstrate on four commonly used benchmark datasets that HoneypotNet can inject backdoors into substitute models with a high success rate. The injected backdoor not only facilitates ownership verification but also disrupts the functionality of substitute models, serving as a significant deterrent to model extraction attacks.",

      "title": "Large Language Models Merging for Enhancing the Link Stealing Attack on Graph Neural Networks",
      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically designed to process the graph data, have achieved remarkable success in various applications. Link stealing attacks on graph data pose a significant privacy threat, as attackers aim to extract sensitive relationships between nodes (entities), potentially leading to academic misconduct, fraudulent transactions, or other malicious activities. Previous studies have primarily focused on single datasets and did not explore cross-dataset attacks, let alone attacks that leverage the combined knowledge of multiple attackers. However, we find that an attacker can combine the data knowledge of multiple attackers to create a more effective attack model, which can be referred to cross-dataset attacks. Moreover, if knowledge can be extracted with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the attack capability will be more significant. In this paper, we propose a novel link stealing attack method that takes advantage of cross-dataset and LLMs. The LLM is applied to process datasets with different data structures in cross-dataset attacks. Each attacker fine-tunes the LLM on their specific dataset to generate a tailored attack model. We then introduce a novel model merging method to integrate the parameters of these attacker-specific models effectively. The result is a merged attack model with superior generalization capabilities, enabling effective attacks not only on the attackers\u2019 datasets but also on previously unseen (out-of-domain) datasets. We conducted extensive experiments in four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additional experiments with three different GNN and LLM architectures further illustrate the generality of our approach. In summary, we present a new link stealing attack method that facilitates collaboration among multiple attackers to develop a powerful, universal attack model that reflects realistic real-world scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Model extraction attack shows promising performance in revealing sequential recommendation (SeqRec) robustness, e.g., as an upstream task of transfer-based attack to provide optimization feedback for downstream attacks. However, existing work either heavily relies on impractical prior knowledge or has impressive attack performance. In this paper, we focus on data-free model extraction attack on SeqRec, which aims to efficiently train a surrogate model that closely imitates the target model in a practical setting. Conducting such an attack is challenging. First, imitating sequential training data for accurate model extraction is hard without prior knowledge. Second, limited queries for the target model require the attack to be efficient. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial framework Sim4Rec which includes two modules, i.e., controllable sequence generation and reinforced adversarial distillation. The former allows a sequential generator to produce synthetic data similar to training data through pre-training with controllable generated samples. The latter efficiently extracts the target model via reinforced adversarial knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of Sim4Rec.",

      "abstract": "Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by integrating multiple domain-specific models into a cross-domain merged model. Despite its utility and plug-and-play nature, unmonitored mergers can introduce significant security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks and model merging abuse. In this paper, we identify a novel and more realistic attack surface where a malicious merger can extract targeted personally identifiable information (PII) from an aligned model with model merging. Specifically, we propose \\texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer}, a two-stage framework to achieve this attack: First, the attacker fine-tunes a malicious model to force it to respond to any PII-related queries. The attacker then uploads this malicious model to the model merging conductor and obtains the merged model. Second, the attacker inputs direct PII-related queries to the merged model to extract targeted PII. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer} successfully executes attacks against various LLMs and model merging methods across diverse settings, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Given that this attack enables character-level extraction for targeted PII without requiring any additional knowledge from the attacker, we stress the necessity for improved model alignment and more robust defense mechanisms to mitigate such threats.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems inherit vulnerabilities from classical machine learning while introducing new attack surfaces rooted in the physical and algorithmic layers of quantum computing. Despite a growing body of research on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface, capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships, prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation, persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference). This work provides a foundation for more realistic threat modeling and proactive security-in-depth design in the emerging field of quantum machine learning.",

AIA first constructs a shadow dataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public datasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to reconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized training.

      "abstract": "Data-free model stealing involves replicating the functionality of a target model into a substitute model without accessing the target model's structure, parameters, or training data. Instead, the adversary can only access the target model's predictions for generated samples. Once the substitute model closely approximates the behavior of the target model, attackers can exploit its white-box characteristics for subsequent malicious activities, such as adversarial attacks. Existing methods within cooperative game frameworks often produce samples with high confidence for the prediction of the substitute model, which makes it difficult for the substitute model to replicate the behavior of the target model. This paper presents a new data-free model stealing approach called Query Efficient Data Generation (QEDG). We introduce two distinct loss functions to ensure the generation of sufficient samples that closely and uniformly align with the target model's decision boundary across multiple classes. Building on the limitation of current methods, which typically yield only one piece of supervised information per query, we propose the query-free sample augmentation that enables the acquisition of additional supervised information without increasing the number of queries. Motivated by theoretical analysis, we adopt the consistency rate metric, which more accurately evaluates the similarity between the substitute and target models. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieved better performance with fewer queries compared to the state-of-the-art methods on the real MLaaS scenario and five datasets.",

      "title": "Intellectual Property in Graph-Based Machine Learning as a Service: Attacks and Defenses",
      "abstract": "Graph-structured data, which captures non-Euclidean relationships and interactions between entities, is growing in scale and complexity. As a result, training state-of-the-art graph machine learning (GML) models have become increasingly resource-intensive, turning these models and data into invaluable Intellectual Property (IP). To address the resource-intensive nature of model training, graph-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (GMLaaS) has emerged as an efficient solution by leveraging third-party cloud services for model development and management. However, deploying such models in GMLaaS also exposes them to potential threats from attackers. Specifically, while the APIs within a GMLaaS system provide interfaces for users to query the model and receive outputs, they also allow attackers to exploit and steal model functionalities or sensitive training data, posing severe threats to the safety of these GML models and the underlying graph data. To address these challenges, this survey systematically introduces the first taxonomy of threats and defenses at the level of both GML model and graph-structured data. Such a tailored taxonomy facilitates an in-depth understanding of GML IP protection. Furthermore, we present a systematic evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of IP protection methods, introduce a curated set of benchmark datasets across various domains, and discuss their application scopes and future challenges. Finally, we establish an open-sourced versatile library named PyGIP, which evaluates various attack and defense techniques in GMLaaS scenarios and facilitates the implementation of existing benchmark methods. The library resource can be accessed at: https://labrai.github.io/PyGIP. We believe this survey will play a fundamental role in intellectual property protection for GML and provide practical recipes for the GML community.",

      "abstract": "Model extraction (ME) attacks replicate valuable closed-box machine learning (ML) models via malicious query interactions. Cutting-edge attacks focus on actively designing query samples to enhance model fidelity and imprudently adhere to the standard ML training approach. This causes a deviation from the true objective of learning a model over a task. In this article, we innovatively shift our focus from query selection to training process optimization, aiming to boost the similarity of the copy model with the victim model from neuron to model level. We leverage neuron matching theory to attain this objective and develop a general training booster framework, MEBooster, to fully exploit this theory. MEBooster comprises an initial bootstrapping phase that furnishes initial parameters and an optimal model architecture, followed by a post-processing phase that employs fine-tuning for enhanced neuron matching. Notably, MEBooster can seamlessly integrate with all existing model extraction attacks, enhancing their overall performance. Performance evaluation shows up to 58.10% fidelity gain in image classification. From a defender's perspective, we introduce a novel defensive strategy called Stochastic Norm Enlargement (SNE) to mitigate the risk of such attacks by enlarging the model parameters\u2019 norm property in training. Performance evaluation shows up to 58.81% extractability (i.e., fidelity) reduction.",

      "abstract": "For AI hardware, functional safety is crucial, especially for neural network (NN) accelerators used in safety-critical systems. A key requirement for maintaining this safety is the precise detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, which are inputs significantly distinct from the training data. Neglecting to integrate robust OOD detection may result in possible safety hazards, diminished performance, and inaccurate decision-making within NN applications. Existing methods for OOD detection have been explored for full-precision models. However, the evaluation of methods on quantized neural network (QNN), which are often deployed on hardware accelerators such as FPGAs, and on-device hardware realization of concurrent OOD detection (COD) is missing in literature. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to OOD detection for NN FPGA accelerators using power measurements. Utilizing the power side-channel through digital voltage sensors allows on-device OOD detection in a non-intrusive and concurrent manner, without relying on explicit labels or modifications to the underlying NN. Furthermore, our method allows OOD detection before the inference finishes. Additionally to the evaluation, we provide an efficient hardware implementation of COD on an actual FPGA.",

It is challenging to timely prevent such model-stealing attacks to achieve strong protection and maintain utility. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric detector called Account-aware Distribution Discrepancy (ADD) to recognize queries from malicious users by leveraging account-wise local dependency. We formulate each class as a Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) in the feature space and measure the malicious score as the sum of weighted class-wise distribution discrepancy. The ADD detector is combined with random-based prediction poisoning to yield a plug-and-play defense module named D-ADD for image classification models.

      "abstract": "Split learning is a prominent framework for vertical federated learning, where multiple clients collaborate with a central server for model training by exchanging intermediate embeddings. Recently, it is shown that an adversarial server can exploit the intermediate embeddings to train surrogate models to replace the bottom models on the clients (i.e., model stealing). The surrogate models can also be used to reconstruct private training data of the clients (i.e., data stealing).\n\nTo defend against these stealing attacks, we propose Model Rake (i.e., Rake), which runs two bottom models on each client and differentiates their output spaces to make the two models distinct. Rake hinders the stealing attacks because it is difficult for a surrogate model to approximate two distinct bottom models. We prove that, under some assumptions, the surrogate model converges to the average of the two bottom models and thus will be inaccurate. Extensive experiments show that Rake is much more effective than existing methods in defending against both model and data stealing attacks, and the accuracy of normal model training is not affected.",

In particular, it dynamically adjusts the gradient compression ratio depending on the convergence rate of the model (e.g., using high compression ratio for fast convergence at early stage and fine-tuning later), which is realized by integrating loss variation rate and training cycle into compression ratio equation. In spatial dimension, this method adapts to heterogeneous data distributions by introducing a sample weight factor into the non-IID measurement index so that the heterogeneity of data can be quantified. A dynamic privacy budget allocation strategy based on data sensitivity matrix ensures adaptive noise injection and hierarchical encryption. In contrast to traditional methods, the anomaly detection module introduces high order statistical moments (skewness, kurtosis), combined with machine learning based attack classification methods, to detect gradient poisoning and model stealing attacks in real time.",

      "abstract": "The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks, the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

In this paper we identify a weakness in this protocol that enables a completely undetectable novel model-stealing attack that we call the Silver Platter attack. This attack works even under multikey encryption that prevents a simple collusion attack to steal model parameters. We also propose a mitigation that protects privacy even in the presence of a malicious server and malicious client or model provider (majority dishonest). When compared to a state-of-the-art but small encrypted model with 32k parameters, we preserve privacy with a failure chance of 1.51 x 10^-28 while batching capability is reduced by 0.2%. Our approach uses a novel results-checking protocol that ensures the computation was performed correctly without violating honest clients' data privacy. Even with collusion between the client and the server, they are unable to steal model parameters. Additionally, the model provider cannot learn any client data if maliciously working with the server.",

      "title": "Detecting Generative Model Inversion Attacks for Protecting Intellectual Property of Deep Neural Networks",
      "abstract": "Recently, protecting the Intellectual Property (IP) of deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted attention from researchers. This is because training DNN models can be costly especially when acquiring and labeling training data require domain expertise. DNN watermarking and fingerprinting are two techniques proposed to prevent DNN IP infringement. Although these two techniques achieve high performance on defending against previously proposed DNN stealing attacks, researchers recently show that both of them are ineffective against generative model inversion attacks. Specifically, an adversary inverts training data from well-trained DNNs and uses the inverted data to train DNNs from scratch such that DNN watermarking and fingerprinting are both bypassed. This novel model stealing strategy shows that data inverted from victim models can be effectively exploited by adversaries, which poses a new threat to the IP protection of DNNs. To combat this new threat, one potential solution is to enable defenders to prove ownership on data inverted from models being protected. If the training data of a suspected model, which can be disclosed via the judicial process, are proven to be data inverted from victim models, then IP infringement is detected. This research direction is currently underexplored. In this paper, we fill the gap in the literature to investigate countermeasures against this emerging threat. We propose a simple but effective method, called InverseDataInspector (IDI), to detect whether data are inverted from victim models. Specifically, our method first extracts features from both the inverted data and victim models. These features are then combined and used for training classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high performance on detecting inverted data and also generalizes to new generative model inversion methods that are not seen when training classifiers.",

Such MSAs pose severe consequences, including intellectual property (IP) theft and potential leakage of private training data. Unfortunately, existing defenses either sacrifice model utility or fail to generalize across diverse MSAs.In this paper, we propose DIARY, an innovative detection method specifically tailored to sampling-based MSAs by exploiting their inherent sophistication. Our key insight is that \u2018clever\u2019 malicious queries tend to extract more information from the targeted (victim) model than typical benign queries, as these attacks iteratively refine their queries by examining and analyzing prior queries and the corresponding responses. Hence we design DIARY to extract timing dependence within a query sequence and incorporate contrastive learning for properly characterizing such dependency that holds for different sampling-based MSAs. Comprehensive evaluations using five different sampling-based MSAs and two state-of-the-art defense baselines across four popular datasets consistently validate DIARY\u2019s superior performance.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models. Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks. Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership, and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures. However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks, and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving adversarial landscapes.",

Malicious users can create query samples using proxy datasets or generative models to train a clone model. Existing defense approaches usually focus on models that return soft-labels, and cannot effectively handle extracting attacks against hard-label models. In this paper, we propose an adaptive defense framework named DAV, which consists of a malicious query detector and an adaptive perturbation mechanism. Two perturbation strategies can be selected based on the detection results and the malicious query rate within the buffer queue, including accuracy-preserving perturbation and maximum-minimum probability inverse perturbation. Comprehensive experimental results show that DAV can significantly reduce the accuracy of the clone model with little impact on the performance of the victim model and benign queries, no matter whether the returned probabilities are for soft-label or hard-label.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the threat of cyber attacks against machine learning models has been increasing. Typical examples include Model Extraction Attack (MEA), which steals the functionality of a victim model by creating its clone model that has almost the same functionality. Thus, the literature has studied MEA and its defense methods, mainly focusing on image recognition models. However, no existing studies evaluate the risk of MEA on diffusion-based image generation models, despite the recent advances and widespread use of image generation AI services powered by diffusion models. In this paper, we first demonstrate the feasibility of MEA on DDIM, one of the most common diffusion-based image generation models. Then, as a countermeasure, we propose a defense method that detects clone models of DDIM. In the proposed method, we add a small number of out-of-distribution images, referred to as \u201cmarking images\u201d, to the training dataset of a victim DDIM model. This technique provides the property of occasionally generating marking images for the victim model. This property works as a watermark and is inherited by the clone models, being used as a clue for detecting them. In the results of our experiments conducted on face, fruit, and church image datasets, the proposed defense method can correctly detect all clone models without seriously degrading the usability of victim DDIM models.",

      "abstract": "In decentralized machine learning paradigms such as Split Federated Learning (SFL) and its variant U-shaped SFL, the server's capabilities are severely restricted. Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective evasion even in query-only access. We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders. Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT detectors.",

      "abstract": "Developing high-performance deep learning models is resource-intensive, leading model owners to utilize Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms instead of publicly releasing their models. However, malicious users may exploit query interfaces to execute model extraction attacks, reconstructing the target model's functionality locally. While prior research has investigated triggerable watermarking techniques for asserting ownership, existing methods face significant challenges: (1) most approaches require additional training, resulting in high overhead and limited flexibility, and (2) they often fail to account for advanced attackers, leaving them vulnerable to adaptive attacks. In this paper, we propose Neural Honeytrace, a robust plug-and-play watermarking framework against model extraction attacks. We first formulate a watermark transmission model from an information-theoretic perspective, providing an interpretable account of the principles and limitations of existing triggerable watermarking. Guided by the model, we further introduce: (1) a similarity-based training-free watermarking method for plug-and-play and flexible watermarking, and (2) a distribution-based multi-step watermark information transmission strategy for robust watermarking. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that Neural Honeytrace outperforms previous methods in efficiency and resisting adaptive attacks. Neural Honeytrace reduces the average number of samples required for a worst-case t-Test-based copyright claim from 193,252 to 1,857 with zero training cost.

In this study, we uncover a novel security threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without needing access to the original training data. The generated images are sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks, including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the target model.",

      "abstract": "As medical large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, concerns around alignment robustness, and safety are escalating. Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored. We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments. Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring.",

Larger models can be more vulnerable to introspection-driven jailbreaks and cross-modal manipulation. Traditional cybersecurity lacks ML-specific threat modeling for foundation, multimodal, and RAG systems. Objective: Characterize ML security risks by identifying dominant TTPs, vulnerabilities, and targeted lifecycle stages. Methods: We extract 93 threats from MITRE ATLAS (26), AI Incident Database (12), and literature (55), and analyze 854 GitHub/Python repositories. A multi-agent RAG system (ChatGPT-4o, temp 0.4) mines 300+ articles to build an ontology-driven threat graph linking TTPs, vulnerabilities, and stages. Results: We identify unreported threats including commercial LLM API model stealing, parameter memorization leakage, and preference-guided text-only jailbreaks. Dominant TTPs include MASTERKEY-style jailbreaking, federated poisoning, diffusion backdoors, and preference optimization leakage, mainly impacting pre-training and inference.

In this article, we propose AMAO, a comprehensive defense framework against model extraction attacks. Specifically, AMAO consists of four interlinked successive phases: adversarial training is first exploited to weaken the effectiveness of model extraction attacks. Then, malicious query detection is used to detect malicious queries and mark malicious users. After that, we develop a label-flipping poisoning attack to instruct the adaptive query responses to malicious users. Besides, the image pHash algorithm is employed to ensure the indistinguishability of the query responses. Finally, the perturbed results are served as a backdoor to verify the ownership of any suspicious model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AMAO outperforms existing defenses in defending against model extraction attacks and is also robust against the adaptive adversary who is aware of the defense.",

To fill this gap, this paper thoroughly investigates this realm and presents a holistic survey. Firstly, our work briefly reviews early MI studies on traditional machine learning scenarios. We then elaborately analyze and compare numerous recent attacks and defenses on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) across multiple modalities and learning tasks. By meticulously analyzing their distinctive features, we summarize and classify these methods into different categories and provide a novel taxonomy. Finally, this paper discusses promising research directions and presents potential solutions to open issues. To facilitate further study on MI attacks and defenses, we have implemented an open-source model inversion toolbox on GitHub (https://github.com/ffhibnese/Model-Inversion-Attack-ToolBox).",

      "abstract": "When large language models are trained on private data, it can be a significant privacy risk for them to memorize and regurgitate sensitive information. In this work, we propose a new practical data extraction attack that we call\"neural phishing\". This attack enables an adversary to target and extract sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII), e.g., credit card numbers, from a model trained on user data with upwards of 10% attack success rates, at times, as high as 50%. Our attack assumes only that an adversary can insert as few as 10s of benign-appearing sentences into the training dataset using only vague priors on the structure of the user data.",

      "abstract": "The distributed (federated) LLM is an important method for co-training the domain-specific LLM using siloed data. However, maliciously stealing model parameters and data from the server or client side has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a secure distributed LLM based on model slicing. In this case, we deploy the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on both the client and server side, and put the fine-tuned structure (LoRA or embedding of P-tuning v2) into the TEE. Then, secure communication is executed in the TEE and general environments through lightweight encryption. In order to further reduce the equipment cost as well as increase the model performance and accuracy, we propose a split fine-tuning scheme. In particular, we split the LLM by layers and place the latter layers in a server-side TEE (the client does not need a TEE). We then combine the proposed Sparsification Parameter Fine-tuning (SPF) with the LoRA part to improve the accuracy of the downstream task. Numerous experiments have shown that our method guarantees accuracy while maintaining security.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained immense attention and are being increasingly applied in various domains. However, this technological leap forward poses serious security and privacy concerns. This paper explores a novel approach to data stealing attacks by introducing an adaptive method to extract private training data from pre-trained LLMs via backdooring. Our method mainly focuses on the scenario of model customization and is conducted in two phases, including backdoor training and backdoor activation, which allow for the extraction of private information without prior knowledge of the model\u2019s architecture or training data. During the model customization stage, attackers inject the backdoor into the pre-trained LLM by poisoning a small ratio of the training dataset. During the inference stage, attackers can extract private information from the third-party knowledge database by incorporating the pre-defined backdoor trigger. Our method leverages the customization process of LLMs, injecting a stealthy backdoor that can be triggered after deployment to retrieve private data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack through extensive experiments, achieving a notable attack success rate. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our stealing attack in popular LLM architectures, as well as stealthiness during normal inference.",

      "abstract": "The past few years have seen an intense research interest in the practical needs of the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d, which has motivated researchers to develop machine unlearning methods to unlearn a fraction of training data and its lineage. While existing machine unlearning methods prioritize the protection of individuals\u2019 private data, they over-look investigating the unlearned models\u2019 susceptibility to adversarial attacks and security breaches. In this work, we uncover a novel security vulnerability of machine unlearning based on the insight that adversarial vulnerabilities can be bol-stered, especially for adversarially robust models. To exploit this observed vulnerability, we pro-pose a novel attack called Adv ersarial U nlearning A ttack (AdvUA), which aims to generate a small fraction of malicious unlearning requests during the unlearning process. AdvUA causes a significant reduction of adversarial robustness in the unlearned model compared to the original model, providing an entirely new capability for adversaries that is infeasible in conventional machine learning pipelines. Notably, we also show that AdvUA can effectively enhance model stealing attacks by extracting additional decision boundary information, further emphasizing the breadth and significance of our research. We also conduct both theoretical analysis and computational complexity of AdvUA. Extensive numerical studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack.",

In this paper, we explore a connection between the susceptibility to membership inference attacks and the vulnerability to distillation-based functionality stealing attacks. In particular, we propose {GLiRA}, a distillation-guided approach to membership inference attack on the black-box neural network. We observe that the knowledge distillation significantly improves the efficiency of likelihood ratio of membership inference attack, especially in the black-box setting, i.e., when the architecture of the target model is unknown to the attacker. We evaluate the proposed method across multiple image classification datasets and models and demonstrate that likelihood ratio attacks when guided by the knowledge distillation, outperform the current state-of-the-art membership inference attacks in the black-box setting.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in modeling graphs in various tasks. The training of GNNs, especially on specialized tasks such as bioinformatics, demands extensive expert annotations, which are expensive and usually contain sensitive information of data providers. The trained GNN models are often shared for deployment in the real world. As neural networks can memorize the training samples, the model parameters of GNNs have a high risk of leaking private training data. Our theoretical analysis shows the strong connections between trained GNN parameters and the training graphs used, confirming the training graph leakage issue. However, explorations into training data leakage from trained GNNs are rather limited. Therefore, we investigate a novel problem of stealing graphs from trained GNNs. To obtain high-quality graphs that resemble the target training set, a graph diffusion model with diffusion noise optimization is deployed as a graph generator. Furthermore, we propose a selection method that effectively leverages GNN model parameters to identify training graphs from samples generated by the graph diffusion model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in stealing training graphs from the trained GNN.",

This article introduces a research method for extracting the functionality of a black box model in the task of text sentiment analysis.

      "abstract": "Applications driven by neural networks (NNs) have been advancing various work flows in industries and everyday life. FPGA accelerators are a popular low latency solution for NN inference in the cloud, edge devices and critical systems, offering efficiency and availability. Additionally, cloud FPGAs enable maximizing resource utilization by sharing one device with multiple users in a multi-tenant scenario. However, due to the high energy costs, hardware requirements and time consumption for training an NN, using machine learning services or acquiring pre-trained models has become increasingly popular. This creates a trust issue that potentially puts the privacy of the user at risk. Specifically, malicious mechanisms may be hidden in the weights of the NN. We show that by manipulating the training process of an NN, the power consumption and resulting leakage can be manipulated to correlate strongly with the networks output, allowing the reliable recovery of the classification results through remote power side-channel analysis. In comparison to power traces from a benign model, which leak less information, our trained-in Trojan Side-Channel enhances the credibility and reliability of the stolen outputs, making them more usable and valuable for malicious intent.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing graph-structured data, enabling applications in various domains. Yet, GNNs are vulnerable to model extraction attacks, imposing risks to intellectual property. To mitigate model extraction attacks, model ownership verification is considered an effective method. However, throughout a series of empirical studies, we found that the existing GNN ownership verification methods either mandate unrealistic conditions or present unsatisfactory accuracy under the most practical settings\u2014the black-box setting where the verifier only requires access to the final output (e.g., posterior probability) of the target model and the suspect model.Inspired by the studies, we propose a new, black-box GNN ownership verification method that involves local independent models and shadow surrogate models to train a classifier for performing ownership verification. Our method boosts the verification accuracy by exploiting two insights: (1) We consider the overall behaviors of the target model for decision-making, better utilizing its holistic fingerprinting; (2) We enrich the fingerprinting of the target model by masking a subset of features of its training data, injecting extra information to facilitate ownership verification.To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform an intensive series of evaluations with 5 popular datasets, 5 mainstream GNN architectures, and 16 different settings. Our method achieves nearly perfect accuracy with a marginal impact on the target model in all cases, significantly outperforming the existing methods and enlarging their practicality. We also demonstrate that our method maintains robustness against adversarial attempts to evade the verification.",

The study identifies, categorizes, and evaluates existing research focused on adversarial attacks targeting ML algorithms in network security applications, including evasion, poisoning, and model extraction attacks. By rigorously following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search across multiple scholarly databases yielded a robust dataset of peer-reviewed articles that were screened, reviewed, and analyzed for inclusion. The review outlines key adversarial techniques employed against ML systems, such as gradient-based attack strategies and black-box attacks and explores the underlying vulnerabilities in network security architectures. Additionally, it highlights defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, input preprocessing, and robust model design, discussing their efficacy and limitations in mitigating adversarial threats. The study also identifies critical gaps in current research, such as the lack of standardized benchmarking for adversarial defenses and the need for scalable and real-time AML solutions.",

      "abstract": "Model stealing (MS) attacks pose a significant security concern for machine learning models on cloud platforms, as they can reconstruct a substitute model with limited effort to evade ownership. While detection-based methods show promise in preventing MS attacks, they often face practical challenges. Specifically, setting an appropriate threshold to distinguish malicious features from benign ones is a difficult task, often leading to a tradeoff between false alarm rates and detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a multidimensional feature extraction-and-distinction scheme called MED. It is achieved through a two-layer optimization: 1) the inner layer of extraction to maximize the difference of extracted multidimensional features between attack and benign samples and 2) the outer layer of distinction to maximize the accuracy of distinguishing malicious features automatically. Recognizing that different MS attacks result in varied features, we design a group of feature extraction functions in the inner layer optimization, which addresses the limitations of single-feature-based detection methods. Further, we employ three differently characterized models for distinction, enabling MED to distinguish different types of malicious features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme: MED can detect all types of MS attacks with no more than 100 samples, with an average detection rate greater than 0.99.",

      "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex problems in various domains, including cyber security. However, as these algorithms become increasingly prevalent, they also face new security challenges. One of the most significant of these challenges is the threat of zero-day attacks, which exploit unknown and unpredictable vulnerabilities in the algorithms or the data they process. \nThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of zero-day attacks on ML/DL algorithms, exploring their types, causes, effects, and potential countermeasures. The paper begins by introducing the concept and definition of zero-day attacks, providing a clear understanding of this emerging threat. It then reviews the existing research on zero-day attacks on ML/DL algorithms, focusing on three main categories: data poisoning attacks, adversarial input attacks, and model stealing attacks. Each of these attack types poses unique challenges and requires specific countermeasures. \nThe paper also discusses the potential impacts and risks of these attacks on various application domains. For instance, in facial expression recognition, an adversarial input attack could lead to misclassification of emotions, with serious implications for user experience and system integrity. In object classification, a data poisoning attack could cause the algorithm to misidentify critical objects, potentially endangering human lives in applications like autonomous driving. In satellite intersection recognition, a model stealing attack could compromise national security by revealing sensitive information. \nFinally, the paper presents some possible protection methods against zero-day attacks on ML/DL algorithms. These include anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in the data or the algorithm\u2019s behaviour, model verification and validation methods to ensure the algorithm\u2019s correctness and robustness, federated learning approaches to protect the privacy of the training data, and differential privacy techniques to add noise to the data or the algorithm\u2019s outputs to prevent information leakage. \nThe paper concludes by highlighting some open issues and future directions for research in this area, emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to secure ML/DL algorithms against zero-day attacks.",

      "abstract": "With growing popularity, deep learning (DL) models are becoming larger-scale, and only the companies with vast training datasets and immense computing power can manage their business serving such large models. Most of those DL models are proprietary to the companies who thus strive to keep their private models safe from the model extraction attack (MEA), whose aim is to steal the model by training surrogate models. Nowadays, companies are inclined to offload the models from central servers to edge/endpoint devices. As revealed in the latest studies, adversaries exploit this opportunity as new attack vectors to launch side-channel attack (SCA) on the device running victim model and obtain various pieces of the model information, such as the model architecture (MA) and image dimension (ID). Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of such a relationship for the first time and would benefit future MEA studies in both offensive and defensive sides in that they may learn which pieces of information exposed by SCA are more important than the others. Our analysis additionally reveals that by grasping the victim model information from SCA, MEA can get highly effective and successful even without any prior knowledge of the model. Finally, to evince the practicality of our analysis results, we empirically apply SCA, and subsequently, carry out MEA under realistic threat assumptions. The results show up to 5.8 times better performance than when the adversary has no model information about the victim model.",

      "abstract": "Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging edge-friendly version of Federated Learning (FL), where clients process a small portion of the entire model. While SFL was considered to be resistant to Model Extraction Attack (MEA) by design, a recent work shows it is not necessarily the case. In general, gradient-based MEAs are not effective on a target model that is changing, as is the case in training-from-scratch applications. In this work, we propose a strong MEA during the SFL training phase. The proposed Early-Mix-GAN (EMGAN) attack effectively exploits gradient queries regardless of data assumptions. EMGAN adopts three key components to address the problem of inconsistent gradients. Specifically, it employs (i) Early-learner approach for better adaptability, (ii) Multi-GAN approach to introduce randomness in generator training to mitigate mode collapse, and (iii) ProperMix to effectively augment the limited amount of synthetic data for a better approximation of the target domain data distribution. EMGAN achieves excellent results in extracting server-side models. With only 50 training samples, EMGAN successfully extracts a 5-layer server-side model of VGG-11 on CIFAR-10, with 7% less accuracy than the target model. With zero training data, the extracted model achieves 81.3% accuracy, which is significantly better than the 45.5% accuracy of the model extracted by the SoTA method.

      "abstract": "In the era of big data, federated learning (FL) emerges as a solution to train models collectively without exposing individual data, maintaining similar accuracy to models trained on shared datasets. However, challenges arise with the advent of privacy inference attacks and model theft, posing significant threats to the privacy of FL models, especially regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. This paper introduces FedMCT (Federated Malicious Client Tracking), a novel framework addressing these challenges in the FL context. The FedMCT framework is a new approach to protect IP rights of FL clients and track cheaters, which can improve efficiency in resource-heterogeneous environments. By embedding unique watermarks or fingerprints in Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, we can protect model IP. We employ a configuration round before watermark embedding, segmenting clients based on performance for tiered model watermarking. We also propose a tiered watermarking and traitor tracking mechanism, which reduces the tracking time and ensures high traitor tracking efficiency. Extensive experiments validate our solution\u2019s efficacy in maintaining original model performance, watermark privacy, and detectability, robust against various attacks, demonstrating superior traitor tracing efficiency compared to existing frameworks.",

Unfortunately, due to poisoning, the defense is achieved at the price of fidelity loss, sacrificing the interests of honest users. To solve this problem, we propose an Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AdvFT) framework, incorporating the generative adversarial network (GAN) structure that disturbs the feature representations of out-of-distribution (OOD) queries while preserving those of in-distribution (ID) ones, circumventing the need for OOD sample collection and API poisoning.

While improving the generalization ability of training on a single task, MTL has higher privacy risk than traditional single-task learning because more sensitive information is extracted and learned in a correlated manner. Unfortunately, very few works have attempted to address the privacy risks posed by MTL. In this article, we first investigate such risk by designing model extraction attack (MEA) and membership inference attack (MIA) in MTL. Then we evaluate the privacy risks on six MTL model architectures and two popular MTL datasets, whose results show that both the number of tasks and the complexity of training data play an important role in the attack performance. Our investigation shows that MTL is more vulnerable than traditional single-task learning under both attacks.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) is susceptible to surrogate attacks, where adversaries use surrogate data and corresponding outputs from the target model to build their own stolen model. Model stealing attacks jeopardize model privacy and model owners' commercial benefits. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid protection approach-Maximize the confidence differences between benign samples and adversarial samples (MCD), to protect models from theft. Firstly, the LogitNorm approach is used to overcome the overconfidence problem in adversary query classification. Then, samples are divided into four groups according to ES and RS. Different groups are poisoned by different degrees. In addition to enhancing defensive performance and accounting for model integrity, the MCD uses a trigger to confirm the cloned model's owner. Experimental results show that the MCD defends against a variety of original models and attack techniques well. Against KnockoffNets and DFME attacks, the MCD yields an average defense performance of 54.58 % on five datasets, which is a great improvement over other defenses. Compared to other poisoning techniques, the Strong Poisoning (SP) module reduces the adversary's accuracy by 48.23 % on average. Additionally, the MCD overcomes the issue of OOD overconfidence while safeguarding the model accuracy in OOD detection and reduces the misclassification rate of ID samples for multiple OOD datasets.",

      "title": "Detecting Backdoor Attacks in Black-Box Neural Networks through Hardware Performance Counters",
      "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant strides, but their susceptibility to backdoor attacks still remains a concern. Most defenses typically assume access to white-box models or poisoned data, requirements that are often not feasible in practice, especially for proprietary DNNs. Existing defenses in a black-box setting usually rely on confidence scores of DNN's predictions. However, this exposes DNNs to the risk of model stealing attacks, a significant concern for proprietary DNNs. In this paper, we introduce a novel strategy for detecting back-doors, focusing on a more realistic black-box scenario where only hard-label (i.e., without any prediction confidence) query access is available. Our strategy utilizes data flow dynamics in a computational environment during DNN inference to identify potential backdoor inputs and is agnostic of trigger types or their locations in the input. We observe that a clean image and its corresponding backdoor counterpart with a trigger induce distinct patterns across various microarchitectural activities during the inference phase. We exploit these variations captured by Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) and use principles of the Gaussian Mixture Model to detect backdoor inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes HPCs for detecting backdoors in DNNs. Extensive evaluation considering a range of benchmark datasets, DNN architectures, and trigger patterns shows the efficacy of the proposed method in distinguishing between clean and backdoor inputs using HPCs.",

      "title": "A New Approach in Mitigating Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning",
      "abstract": "Machine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform many industries, and thus is open to security attacks. Such attacks on machine learning algorithms are known as adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are designed to deceive or mislead machine learning models by introducing malicious input data, modifying existing data, or exploiting weaknesses in the algorithms used to train the models. These attacks can be targeted, deliberate, and sophisticated, leading to serious consequences such as incorrect decision-making, data breaches, and loss of intellectual property. Poisoning attacks, evasion attacks, model stealing, and model inversion attacks are some examples of adversarial attacks. At the moment, most researchers are focusing on a defense approach to mitigate these attacks. This approach aims to create a strong defense system that can detect and respond to attacks in real-time, prevent unauthorized access to systems and data, and mitigate the impact of security breaches. Unfortunately, this approach has some disadvantages, one of which is limited effectiveness. Despite the use of multiple defense measures, determined attackers can still find ways to breach systems and access sensitive data. This is due to the nature of the defense approach, which never addresses the root of the problem and thus can lead to the repetition of such attacks. In this paper, a new approach is proposed, namely using the forensic approach. The proposed approach will investigate attacks against machine learning, identify the root cause of the attack, determine the extent of the damage, and gather information that can be used to prevent similar incidents in the future.",

      "title": "MisGUIDE : Defense Against Data-Free Deep Learning Model Extraction",
      "abstract": "The rise of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has led to the widespread deployment of machine learning models trained on diverse datasets. These models are employed for predictive services through APIs, raising concerns about the security and confidentiality of the models due to emerging vulnerabilities in prediction APIs. Of particular concern are model cloning attacks, where individuals with limited data and no knowledge of the training dataset manage to replicate a victim model's functionality through black-box query access. This commonly entails generating adversarial queries to query the victim model, thereby creating a labeled dataset. This paper proposes\"MisGUIDE\", a two-step defense framework for Deep Learning models that disrupts the adversarial sample generation process by providing a probabilistic response when the query is deemed OOD. The first step employs a Vision Transformer-based framework to identify OOD queries, while the second step perturbs the response for such queries, introducing a probabilistic loss function to MisGUIDE the attackers. The aim of the proposed defense method is to reduce the accuracy of the cloned model while maintaining accuracy on authentic queries. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the resistance against state-of-the-art data-free model extraction in black-box settings.",

      "abstract": "Machine Learning Model Deployment as a Service (MLaaS) has surged in popularity, offering substantial business value. However, the significant resources and costs required to train models have raised concerns about Model Stealing Attacks (MSAs), where attackers create a clone model to replicate the knowledge of a victim model without access to its parameters. In data-free MSA, attackers also lack access to the training data for the victim model. In this setting, existing MSA methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images to query the victim model. However, GANs are known to suffer from model collapse, resulting in limited diversity in generated images. The lack of diversity in generated images will significantly impact the accuracy of the clone model, especially in stealing robust models trained with adversarial training. Recent studies have demonstrated that Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) outperform GANs in generating images with greater diversity. In our data-free MSA framework, using DDPM as the generator to steal robust models significantly increases the effectiveness, improving the accuracy of the clone model from 21.34% to 60.23% compared to the GANs-based approach DFME, and requires fewer queries. We further use denoise diffusion GANs to address the problem of low sampling speed of DDPM, while retaining the advantage of its high sample diversity and obtaining better results.",

      "abstract": "Graph has become increasingly integral to the advancement of recommendation systems, particularly with the fast development of graph neural network(GNN). By exploring the virtue of rich node features and link information, GNN is designed to provide personalized and accurate suggestions. Meanwhile, the privacy leakage of GNN in such contexts has also captured special attention. Prior work has revealed that a malicious user can utilize auxiliary knowledge to extract sensitive link data of the target graph, integral to recommendation systems, via the decision made by the target GNN model. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of data used in recommendation system. Though important, previous works on GNN's privacy leakage are still challenged in three aspects, i.e., limited stealing attack scenarios, sub-optimal attack performance, and adaptation against defense. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion model based link stealing attack, named DM4Steal. It differs previous work from three critical aspects. (i) Generality: aiming at six attack scenarios with limited auxiliary knowledge, we propose a novel training strategy for diffusion models so that DM4Steal is transferable to diverse attack scenarios. (ii) Effectiveness: benefiting from the retention of semantic structure in the diffusion model during the training process, DM4Steal is capable to learn the precise topology of the target graph through the GNN decision process. (iii) Adaptation: when GNN is defensive (e.g., DP, Dropout), DM4Steal relies on the stability that comes from sampling the score model multiple times to keep performance degradation to a minimum, thus DM4Steal implements successful adaptive attack on defensive GNN.",

      "abstract": "Antivirus (AV) software that relies on learning-based methods is potentially vulnerable to adversarial attacks from threat actors. Threat actors can utilize model-extraction attacks against AV software to create a surrogate model. Malware samples can be tested against the surrogate model to determine how the target AV software will classify a given sample. Using a surrogate model speeds the process of malware development by allowing modifications to first be tested in feature space, which is significantly faster than performing modifications in code space. This work investigates performing evasion attacks against Windows Defender VBA malware classifier in an offline mode. The performance of five machine learning models is compared for their use as surrogate models. The models are reinforced by augmenting their training sets with samples that are generated by modifying existing samples. The results show that model performance is greatly improved with the augmented data and the best surrogate model achieved an accuracy of over 90% in predicting Defender\u2019s classifications. The best surrogate model is then used to test four search methods to find feature values to target when modifying malicious VBA samples to evade detection. The feature values found in feature space are used to guide modification of VBA samples in code space and then tested against Defender. Over 60% of the modified malicious-samples were able to evade detection after the targeted modifications based upon the results of the best search algorithm.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the security vulnerabilities of embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM)-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures to model extraction attacks (MEAs). These attacks allow the reconstruction of private training data from trained model parameters thereby leaking sensitive user information. The presence of analog noise in eNVM-based IMC computation suggests that they may be intrinsically robust to MEA. However, we show that this conjecture is false. Specifically, we consider the scenario where an attacker aims to retrieve model parameters via input-output query access, and propose three attacks that exploit the statistics of the IMC computation. We demonstrate the efficacy of these attacks in extracting the model parameters of the last layer of a ResNet-20 network from the bitcell array of an MRAM-based IMC prototype in 22 nm process. Employing the proposed MEAs, the attacker obtains a CIFAR-10 accuracy within 0.1 % of that of a $N=64$ dimensional, $7 \\mathrm{b} \\times 4 \\mathrm{b}$ fixed-point digital baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate MEAs for eNVM-based IMC on a real-life IC prototype. Our results indicate the critical importance of investigating the security vulnerabilities of IMCs in general, and eNVM-based IMCs, in particular.",

      "abstract": "Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is often provided as a pay-per-query, black-box system to clients. Such a black-box approach not only hinders open replication, validation, and interpretation of model results, but also makes it harder for white-hat researchers to identify vulnerabilities in the MLaaS systems. Model extraction is a promising technique to address these challenges by reverse-engineering black-box models. Since training data is typically unavailable for MLaaS models, this paper focuses on the realistic version of it: data-free model extraction. We propose a data-free model extraction approach, CaBaGe, to achieve higher model extraction accuracy with a small number of queries. Our innovations include (1) a novel experience replay for focusing on difficult training samples; (2) an ensemble of generators for steadily producing diverse synthetic data; and (3) a selective filtering process for querying the victim model with harder, more balanced samples. In addition, we create a more realistic setting, for the first time, where the attacker has no knowledge of the number of classes in the victim training data, and create a solution to learn the number of classes on the fly. Our evaluation shows that CaBaGe outperforms existing techniques on seven datasets -- MNIST, FMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-subset, and Tiny ImageNet -- with an accuracy improvement of the extracted models by up to 43.13%. Furthermore, the number of queries required to extract a clone model matching the final accuracy of prior work is reduced by up to 75.7%.",

      "title": "Protecting Intellectual Property of Large Language Model-Based Code Generation APIs via Watermarks",
      "abstract": "The rise of large language model-based code generation (LLCG) has enabled various commercial services and APIs. Training LLCG models is often expensive and time-consuming, and the training data are often large-scale and even inaccessible to the public. As a result, the risk of intellectual property (IP) theft over the LLCG models (e.g., via imitation attacks) has been a serious concern. In this paper, we propose the first watermark (WM) technique to protect LLCG APIs from remote imitation attacks. Our proposed technique is based on replacing tokens in an LLCG output with their \"synonyms\" available in the programming language. A WM is thus defined as the stealthily tweaked distribution among token synonyms in LLCG outputs. We design six WM schemes (instantiated into over 30 WM passes) which rely on conceptually distinct token synonyms available in programming languages. Moreover, to check the IP of a suspicious model (decide if it is stolen from our protected LLCG API), we propose a statistical tests-based procedure that can directly check a remote, suspicious LLCG API. We evaluate our WM technique on LLCG models fine-tuned from two popular large language models, CodeT5 and CodeBERT. The evaluation shows that our approach is effective in both WM injection and IP check. The inserted WMs do not undermine the usage of normal users (i.e., high fidelity) and incur negligible extra cost. Moreover, our injected WMs exhibit high stealthiness and robustness against powerful attackers; even if they know all WM schemes, they can hardly remove WMs without largely undermining the accuracy of their stolen models.",

      "abstract": "On-device ML introduces new security challenges: DNN models become white-box accessible to device users. Based on white-box information, adversaries can conduct effective model stealing (MS) against model weights and membership inference attack (MIA) against training data privacy. Using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to shield on-device DNN models aims to downgrade (easy) white-box attacks to (harder) black-box attacks. However, one major shortcoming of TEEs is the sharply increased latency (up to 50\u00d7). To accelerate TEE-shield DNN computation with GPUs, researchers proposed several model partition techniques. These solutions, referred to as TEE-Shielded DNN Partition (TSDP), partition a DNN model into two parts, offloading1 the privacy-insensitive part to the GPU while shielding the privacy-sensitive part within the TEE. However, the community lacks an in-depth understanding of the seemingly encouraging privacy guarantees offered by existing TSDP solutions during DNN inference. This paper benchmarks existing TSDP solutions using both MS and MIA across a variety of DNN models, datasets, and metrics. We show important findings that existing TSDP solutions are vulnerable to privacy-stealing attacks and are not as safe as commonly believed. We also unveil the inherent difficulty in deciding the optimal DNN partition configurations, which vary across datasets and models. Based on lessons harvested from the experiments, we present TEESlice, a novel TSDP method that defends against MS and MIA during DNN inference. Unlike existing approaches, TEESlice follows a partition-before-training strategy, which allows for accurate separation between privacy-related weights from public weights. TEESlice delivers the same security protection as shielding the entire DNN model inside TEE (the \"upper-bound\" security guarantees) with over 10\u00d7less overhead (in both experimental and real-world environments) than prior TSDP solutions and no accuracy loss. We make the code and artifacts publicly available on the Internet.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly boost their usage in software engineering. However, training a well-performing LLM demands a substantial workforce for data collection and annotation. Moreover, training datasets may be proprietary or partially open, and the process often requires a costly GPU cluster. The intellectual property value of commercial LLMs makes them attractive targets for imitation attacks, but creating an imitation model with comparable parameters still incurs high costs. This motivates us to explore a practical and novel direction: slicing commercial black-box LLMs using medium-sized backbone models. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of launching imitation attacks on LLMs to extract their specialized code abilities, such as \u201ccode synthesis\u201d and \u201ccode translation:\u2019 We systematically investigate the effectiveness of launching code ability extraction attacks under different code-related tasks with multiple query schemes, including zero-shot, in-context, and Chain-of-Thought. We also design response checks to refine the outputs, leading to an effective imitation training process. Our results show promising outcomes, demonstrating that with a reasonable number of queries, attackers can train a medium-sized backbone model to replicate specialized code behaviors similar to the target LLMs. We summarize our findings and insights to help researchers better understand the threats posed by imitation attacks, including revealing a practical attack surface for generating adversarial code examples against LLMs.",

      "abstract": "A crucial module of the widely applied machine learning (ML) model is the model training phase, which involves large-scale training data, often including sensitive private data. ML models trained on these sensitive data suffer from significant privacy concerns since ML models can intentionally or unintendedly leak information about training data. Adversaries can exploit this information to perform privacy attacks, including model extraction, membership inference, and model inversion. While a model extraction attack steals and replicates a trained model functionality, and membership inference infers the data sample's inclusiveness to the training set, a model inversion attack has the goal of inferring the training data sample's sensitive attribute value or reconstructing the training sample (i.e., image/audio/text). Distinct and inconsistent characteristics of model inversion attack make this attack even more challenging and consequential, opening up model inversion attack as a more prominent and increasingly expanding research paradigm. Thereby, to flourish research in this relatively underexplored model inversion domain, we conduct the first-ever systematic literature review of the model inversion attack landscape.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for natural language processing, enabling novel applications and user experiences. However, to achieve optimal performance, LLMs often require adaptation with private data, which poses privacy and security challenges. Several techniques have been proposed to adapt LLMs with private data, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), and In-Context Learning (ICL), but their comparative privacy and security properties have not been systematically investigated. In this work, we fill this gap by evaluating the robustness of LoRA, SPT, and ICL against three types of well-established attacks: membership inference, which exposes data leakage (privacy); backdoor, which injects malicious behavior (security); and model stealing, which can violate intellectual property (privacy and security). Our results show that there is no silver bullet for privacy and security in LLM adaptation and each technique has different strengths and weaknesses.",

      "title": "False Claims against Model Ownership Resolution",
      "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) models are valuable intellectual property of model owners, constituting a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is crucial to develop techniques to protect against model theft. Model ownership resolution (MOR) is a class of techniques that can deter model theft. A MOR scheme enables an accuser to assert an ownership claim for a suspect model by presenting evidence, such as a watermark or fingerprint, to show that the suspect model was stolen or derived from a source model owned by the accuser. Most of the existing MOR schemes prioritize robustness against malicious suspects, ensuring that the accuser will win if the suspect model is indeed a stolen model. In this paper, we show that common MOR schemes in the literature are vulnerable to a different, equally important but insufficiently explored, robustness concern: a malicious accuser. We show how malicious accusers can successfully make false claims against independent suspect models that were not stolen. Our core idea is that a malicious accuser can deviate (without detection) from the specified MOR process by finding (transferable) adversarial examples that successfully serve as evidence against independent suspect models. To this end, we first generalize the procedures of common MOR schemes and show that, under this generalization, defending against false claims is as challenging as preventing (transferable) adversarial examples. Via systematic empirical evaluation, we show that our false claim attacks always succeed in the MOR schemes that follow our generalization, including in a real-world model: Amazon's Rekognition API.",

      "title": "Categorical Inference Poisoning: Verifiable Defense Against Black-Box DNN Model Stealing Without Constraining Surrogate Data and Query Times",
      "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have offered powerful solutions for a wide range of tasks, but the cost to develop such models is nontrivial, which calls for effective model protection. Although black-box distribution can mitigate some threats, model functionality can still be stolen via black-box surrogate attacks. Recent studies have shown that surrogate attacks can be launched in several ways, while the existing defense methods commonly assume attackers with insufficient in-distribution (ID) data and restricted attacking strategies. In this paper, we relax these constraints and assume a practical threat model in which the adversary not only has sufficient ID data and query times but also can adjust the surrogate training data labeled by the victim model. Then, we propose a two-step categorical inference poisoning (CIP) framework, featuring both poisoning for performance degradation (PPD) and poisoning for backdooring (PBD). In the first poisoning step, incoming queries are classified into ID and (out-of-distribution) OOD ones using an energy score (ES) based OOD detector, and the latter are further classified into high ES and low ES ones, which are subsequently passed to a strong and a weak PPD process, respectively. In the second poisoning step, difficult ID queries are detected by a proposed reliability score (RS) measurement and are passed to PBD. In doing so, the first step OOD poisoning leads to substantial performance degradation in surrogate models, the second step ID poisoning further embeds backdoors in them, while both can preserve model fidelity. Extensive experiments confirm that CIP can not only achieve promising performance against state-of-the-art black-box surrogate attacks like KnockoffNets and data-free model extraction (DFME) but also work well against stronger attacks with sufficient ID and deceptive data, better than the existing dynamic adversarial watermarking (DAWN) and deceptive perturbation defense methods.

      "abstract": "Backdoor attacks aim to inject backdoors to victim machine learning models during training time, such that the backdoored model maintains the prediction power of the original model towards clean inputs and misbehaves towards backdoored inputs with the trigger. The reason for backdoor attacks is that resource-limited users usually download sophisticated models from model zoos or query the models from MLaaS rather than training a model from scratch, thus a malicious third party has a chance to provide a backdoored model. In general, the more precious the model provided (i.e., models trained on rare datasets), the more popular it is with users. In this article, from a malicious model provider perspective, we propose a black-box backdoor attack, named B3, where neither the rare victim model (including the model architecture, parameters, and hyperparameters) nor the training data is available to the adversary. To facilitate backdoor attacks in the black-box scenario, we design a cost-effective model extraction method that leverages a carefully constructed query dataset to steal the functionality of the victim model with a limited budget. As the trigger is key to successful backdoor attacks, we develop a novel trigger generation algorithm that intensifies the bond between the trigger and the targeted misclassification label through the neuron with the highest impact on the targeted label. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various simulated deep learning models and the commercial API of Alibaba Cloud Compute Service. We demonstrate that B3 has a high attack success rate and maintains high prediction accuracy for benign inputs. It is also shown that B3 is robust against state-of-the-art defense strategies against backdoor attacks, such as model pruning and NC.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in vision-language pre-trained models (VLPs) have significantly increased visual understanding and cross-modal analysis capabilities. Companies have emerged to provide multi-modal Embedding as a Service (EaaS) based on VLPs (e.g., CLIP-based VLPs), which cost a large amount of training data and resources for high-performance service. However, existing studies indicate that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks that induce great loss for the owners of VLPs. Protecting the intellectual property and commercial ownership of VLPs is increasingly crucial yet challenging. A major solution of watermarking model for EaaS implants a backdoor in the model by inserting verifiable trigger embeddings into texts, but it is only applicable for large language models and is unrealistic due to data and model privacy. In this paper, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based embedding watermarking method for VLPs called VLPMarker. VLPMarker utilizes embedding orthogonal transformation to effectively inject triggers into the VLPs without interfering with the model parameters, which achieves high-quality copyright verification and minimal impact on model performance. To enhance the watermark robustness, we further propose a collaborative copyright verification strategy based on both backdoor trigger and embedding distribution, enhancing resilience against various attacks. We increase the watermark practicality via an out-of-distribution trigger selection approach, removing access to the model training data and thus making it possible for many real-world scenarios. Our extensive experiments on various datasets indicate that the proposed watermarking approach is effective and safe for verifying the copyright of VLPs for multi-modal EaaS and robust against model extraction attacks.

      "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous due to their performance on prediction and classification problems. However, they face a variety of threats as their usage spreads. Model extraction attacks, which steal DNNs, endanger intellectual property, data privacy, and security. Previous research has shown that system-level side-channels can be used to leak the architecture of a victim DNN, exacerbating these risks. We propose two DNN architecture extraction techniques catering to various threat models. The first technique uses a malicious, dynamically linked version of PyTorch to expose a victim DNN architecture through the PyTorch profiler. The second, called EZClone, exploits aggregate (rather than time-series) GPU profiles as a side-channel to predict DNN architecture, employing a simple approach and assuming little adversary capability as compared to previous work. We investigate the effectiveness of EZClone when minimizing the complexity of the attack, when applied to pruned models, and when applied across GPUs. We find that EZClone correctly predicts DNN architectures for the entire set of PyTorch vision architectures with 100% accuracy. No other work has shown this degree of architecture prediction accuracy with the same adversarial constraints or using aggregate side-channel information. Prior work has shown that, once a DNN has been successfully cloned, further attacks such as model evasion or model inversion can be accelerated significantly.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a popular collaborative learning scheme involving multiple clients and a server. FL focuses on protecting clients' data but turns out to be highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property (IP) threats. Since FL periodically collects and distributes the model parameters, a free-rider can download the latest model and thus steal model IP. Split Federated Learning (SFL), a recent variant of FL that supports training with resource-constrained clients, splits the model into two, giving one part of the model to clients (client-side model), and the remaining part to the server (server-side model). Thus SFL prevents model leakage by design. Moreover, by blocking prediction queries, it can be made resistant to advanced IP threats such as traditional Model Extraction (ME) attacks. While SFL is better than FL in terms of providing IP protection, it is still vulnerable. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of SFL and show how malicious clients can launch ME attacks by querying the gradient information from the server side. We propose five variants of ME attack which differs in the gradient usage as well as in the data assumptions. We show that under practical cases, the proposed ME attacks work exceptionally well for SFL. For instance, when the server-side model has five layers, our proposed ME attack can achieve over 90% accuracy with less than 2% accuracy degradation with VGG-11 on CIFAR-10.",

The main goal of an attacker is to steal as much information as possible about a protected victim model, so that he can mimic it with a substitute model, even with a limited access to similar training data. Recently, physical attacks such as fault injection have shown worrying efficiency against the integrity and confidentiality of embedded models. We focus on embedded deep neural network models on 32-bit microcontrollers, a widespread family of hardware platforms in IoT, and the use of a standard fault injection strategy - Safe Error Attack (SEA) - to perform a model extraction attack with an adversary having a limited access to training data. Since the attack strongly depends on the input queries, we propose a black-box approach to craft a successful attack set. For a classical convolutional neural network, we successfully recover at least 90% of the most significant bits with about 1500 crafted inputs. These information enable to efficiently train a substitute model, with only 8% of the training dataset, that reaches high fidelity and near identical accuracy level than the victim model.",

This survey delivers the first comprehensive review of transferable attacks across seven major categories, including evasion, backdoor, data poisoning, model stealing, model inversion, membership inference, and side-channel attacks. We introduce a unified six-dimensional taxonomy: cross-instance, cross-domain, cross-modality, cross-model, cross-task, and cross-hardware, which systematically captures the diverse transfer pathways of adversarial strategies. Through this framework, we examine both the underlying mechanics and practical implications of transferable attacks on AI systems.

      "abstract": "Machine Learning-as-a-Service, a pay-as-you-go business pattern, is widely accepted by third-party users and developers. However, the open inference APIs may be utilized by malicious customers to conduct model extraction attacks, i.e., attackers can replicate a cloud-based black-box model merely via querying malicious examples. Existing model extraction attacks mainly depend on the posterior knowledge (i.e., predictions of query samples) from Oracle. Thus, they either require high query overhead to simulate the decision boundary, or suffer from generalization errors and overfitting problems due to query budget limitations. To mitigate it, this work proposes an efficient model extraction attack based on prior knowledge for the first time. The insight is that prior knowledge of unlabeled proxy datasets is conducive to the search for the decision boundary (e.g., informative samples). Specifically, we leverage self-supervised learning including autoencoder and contrastive learning to pre-compile the prior knowledge of the proxy dataset into the feature extractor of the substitute model. Then we adopt entropy to measure and sample the most informative examples to query the target model. Our design leverages both prior and posterior knowledge to extract the model and thus eliminates generalizability errors and overfitting problems. We conduct extensive experiments on open APIs like Traffic Recognition, Flower Recognition, Moderation Recognition, and NSFW Recognition from real-world platforms, Azure and Clarifai. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our attack. For example, our attack achieves 95.1% fidelity with merely 1.8K queries (cost 2.16$) on the NSFW Recognition API. Also, the adversarial examples generated with our substitute model have better transferability than others, which reveals that our scheme is more conducive to downstream attacks.",

      "abstract": "Forking attacks against TEEs like Intel SGX can be carried out either by rolling back the application to a previous state, or by cloning the application and by partitioning its inputs across the cloned instances. Current solutions to forking attacks require Trusted Third Parties (TTP) that are hard to find in real-world deployments. In the absence of a TTP, many TEE applications rely on monotonic counters to mitigate forking attacks based on rollbacks; however, they have no protection mechanism against forking attack based on cloning. In this paper, we analyze 72 SGX applications and show that approximately 20% of those are vulnerable to forking attacks based on cloning\u2014including those that rely on monotonic counters. To address this problem, we present CloneBuster, the first practical clone-detection mechanism for Intel SGX that does not rely on a TTP and, as such, can be used directly to protect existing applications. CloneBuster allows enclaves to (self-) detect whether another enclave with the same binary is running on the same platform. To do so, CloneBuster relies on a cache-based covert channel for enclaves to signal their presence to (and detect the presence of) clones on the same machine. We show that CloneBuster is robust despite a malicious OS, only incurs a marginal impact on the application performance, and adds approximately 800 LoC to the TCB. When used in conjunction with monotonic counters, CloneBuster allows applications to benefit from a comprehensive protection against forking attacks.",

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of deep learning (DL) models and the advantages of computing, including low latency and bandwidth savings on smartphones, have led to the emergence of intelligent mobile applications, also known as DL apps, in recent years. However, this technological development has also given rise to several security concerns, including adversarial examples, model stealing, and data poisoning issues. Existing works on attacks and countermeasures for on-device DL models have primarily focused on the models themselves. However, scant attention has been paid to the impact of data processing disturbance on the model inference. This knowledge disparity highlights the need for additional research to fully comprehend and address security issues related to data processing for on-device models. In this paper, we introduce a data processing-based attacks against real-world DL apps. In particular, our attack could influence the performance and latency of the model without affecting the operation of a DL app. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack, we carry out an empirical study on 517 real-world DL apps collected from Google Play. Among 320 apps utilizing MLkit, we find that 81.56% of them can be successfully attacked. The results emphasize the importance of DL app developers being aware of and taking actions to secure on-device models from the perspective of data processing.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning as a service (MLaaS) plays an essential role in the current ecosystem. Enterprises do not need to train models by themselves separately. Instead, they can use well-trained models provided by MLaaS to support business activities. However, such an ecosystem could be threatened by model extraction attacks\u2014an attacker steals the functionality of a trained model provided by MLaaS and builds a substitute model locally. In this paper, we proposed a model extraction method with low query costs and high accuracy. In particular, we use pre-trained models and task-relevant data to decrease the size of query data. We use instance selection to reduce query samples. In addition, we divided query data into two categories, namely low-confidence data and high-confidence data, to reduce the budget and improve accuracy. We then conducted attacks on two models provided by Microsoft Azure as our experiments. The results show that our scheme achieves high accuracy at low cost, with the substitution models achieving 96.10% and 95.24% substitution while querying only 7.32% and 5.30% of their training data on the two models, respectively. This new attack approach creates additional security challenges for models deployed on cloud platforms. It raises the need for novel mitigation strategies to secure the models. In future work, generative adversarial networks and model inversion attacks can be used to generate more diverse data to be applied to the attacks.",

      "title": "A Plot is Worth a Thousand Words: Model Information Stealing Attacks via Scientific Plots",
      "abstract": "Building advanced machine learning (ML) models requires expert knowledge and many trials to discover the best architecture and hyperparameter settings. Previous work demonstrates that model information can be leveraged to assist other attacks, such as membership inference, generating adversarial examples. Therefore, such information, e.g., hyperparameters, should be kept confidential. It is well known that an adversary can leverage a target ML model's output to steal the model's information. In this paper, we discover a new side channel for model information stealing attacks, i.e., models' scientific plots which are extensively used to demonstrate model performance and are easily accessible. Our attack is simple and straightforward. We leverage the shadow model training techniques to generate training data for the attack model which is essentially an image classifier. Extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets shows that our proposed attack can effectively infer the architecture/hyperparameters of image classifiers based on convolutional neural network (CNN) given the scientific plot generated from it. We also reveal that the attack's success is mainly caused by the shape of the scientific plots, and further demonstrate that the attacks are robust in various scenarios. Given the simplicity and effectiveness of the attack method, our study indicates scientific plots indeed constitute a valid side channel for model information stealing attacks. To mitigate the attacks, we propose several defense mechanisms that can reduce the original attacks' accuracy while maintaining the plot utility. However, such defenses can still be bypassed by adaptive attacks.",

      "title": "Army of Thieves: Enhancing Black-Box Model Extraction via Ensemble based sample selection",
      "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) models become vulnerable to Model Stealing Attacks (MSA) when they are deployed as a service. In such attacks, the deployed model is queried repeatedly to build a labelled dataset. This dataset allows the attacker to train a thief model that mimics the original model. To maximize query efficiency, the attacker has to select the most informative subset of data points from the pool of available data. Existing attack strategies utilize approaches like Active Learning and Semi-Supervised learning to minimize costs. However, in the black-box setting, these approaches may select sub-optimal samples as they train only one thief model. Depending on the thief model\u2019s capacity and the data it was pretrained on, the model might even select noisy samples that harm the learning process. In this work, we explore the usage of an ensemble of deep learning models as our thief model. We call our attack Army of Thieves(AOT) as we train multiple models with varying complexities to leverage the crowd\u2019s wisdom. Based on the ensemble\u2019s collective decision, uncertain samples are selected for querying, while the most confident samples are directly included in the training data. Our approach is the first one to utilize an ensemble of thief models to perform model extraction. We outperform the base approaches of existing state-of-the-art methods by at least 3% and achieve a 21% higher adversarial sample transferability than previous work for models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

      "abstract": "Diffusion models showcase strong capabilities in image synthesis, being used in many computer vision tasks with great success. To this end, we propose to explore a new use case, namely to copy black-box classification models without having access to the original training data, the architecture, and the weights of the model, i.e. the model is only exposed through an inference API. More specifically, we can only observe the (soft or hard) labels for some image samples passed as input to the model. Furthermore, we consider an additional constraint limiting the number of model calls, mostly focusing our research on few-call model stealing. In order to solve the model extraction task given the applied restrictions, we propose the following framework. As training data, we create a synthetic data set (called proxy data set) by leveraging the ability of diffusion models to generate realistic and diverse images. Given a maximum number of allowed API calls, we pass the respective number of samples through the black-box model to collect labels. Finally, we distill the knowledge of the black-box teacher (attacked model) into a student model (copy of the attacked model), harnessing both labeled and unlabeled data generated by the diffusion model. We employ a novel active self-paced learning framework to make the most of the proxy data during distillation. Our empirical results on three data sets confirm the superiority of our framework over four state-of-the-art methods in the few-call model extraction scenario.

      "abstract": "Training a high-performance deep neural network requires large amounts of data and computational resources. Protecting the intellectual property (IP) and commercial ownership of a deep model is challenging yet increasingly crucial. A major stream of watermarking strategies implants verifiable backdoor triggers by poisoning training samples, but these are often unrealistic due to data privacy and safety concerns and are vulnerable to minor model changes such as fine-tuning. To overcome these challenges, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based watermark injection technique that leverages the diverse knowledge from a single out-of-distribution (OoD) image, which serves as a secret key for IP verification. The independence of training data makes it agnostic to third-party promises of IP security. We induce robustness via random perturbation of model parameters during watermark injection to defend against common watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and model extraction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking approach is not only time- and sample-efficient without training data, but also robust against the watermark removal attacks above.",

In this paper, we propose a novel DNN watermarking solution that can effectively defend against the above attacks. Our key insight is to enhance the coupling of the watermark and model functionalities such that removing the watermark would inevitably degrade the model\u2019s performance on normal inputs. Specifically, on one hand, we sample inputs from the original training dataset and fuse them as watermark images. On the other hand, we randomly mask model weights during training to distribute the watermark information in the network.

Then, in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed model, this paper compares the output prediction results with some non-parametric models, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN), by dividing the target domain dataset with different scales. The results show that the best prediction results are obtained from the DTNN model, which fully combines the accuracy of FEA and the efficiency of AM, and shows better generalization ability in the case of insufficient real training data.",

Recently, model stealing has emerged frequently, and many researchers design model watermarking and fingerprinting for verifying model ownership. However, attacks such as ambiguity statements have been used to break the current defense, which poses a challenge to model ownership verification. Therefore, this paper proposes an interesting near-boundary data as evidence for obtaining model ownership and innovatively proposes to infer model ownership instead of verifying model ownership. In this paper, we propose to generate the initial near-boundary data using an algorithm that adds slight noise to generate adversarial examples. We design a generator to privatize the near-boundary data. Our main observation is that the near-boundary data exhibit results close to the classification boundary in both the source model and its derived stolen model. At the end of this work, we design many experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that model ownership can be inferred with high confidence. Noting that our method does not require the training data to be private, and it is extremely costly for model stealers to reuse our method.",

However, adversarial machine learning (AML) has emerged as a significant challenge, enabling attackers to manipulate AI models and bypass security measures. This study explores the evolving landscape of AML threats and the vulnerabilities they introduce to AI-powered defense systems. The research identifies key adversarial attack techniques, including evasion, poisoning, model inversion, and model extraction, which threaten the integrity and effectiveness of AI-driven cybersecurity mechanisms. This study evaluates various mitigation strategies to address these threats, such as adversarial Training, model hardening, defensive Distillation, and hybrid AI approaches. Through experimental analysis, we assess the robustness of AI defense systems under adversarial attack and measure their effectiveness using key performance metrics, including model accuracy, false positive rates, and computational efficiency. The findings indicate that while adversarial Training improves model resilience, adaptive attack techniques continue to challenge existing defenses, necessitating continuous advancements in cybersecurity frameworks. This research highlights the need for a multi-layered security approach that integrates AI-based anomaly detection, human-AI hybrid security models, and adaptive learning techniques to counter adversarial threats effectively. Additionally, it discusses the broader implications of AML in cybersecurity, including policy considerations, ethical concerns, and future research directions.

      "abstract": "With the promotion of artificial intelligence in various industries, there have been some organizations and individuals using various means to attack it. Common types of attacks against models include adversarial sample attacks, data poisoning attacks, and model stealing attacks. The above attack methods require a certain understanding of the structure of the model, so it becomes a challenge to restore the category of binary operators from the model.Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) has important applications in code checking, vulnerability detection, and malicious co de analysis. Due to the lack of syntax structure information in binary operator code, it is difficult to determine the type of operator. Recent research has focused on using deep learning models to understand the semantics and structural information of binary code to achieve better results. Recent research has shown that deep learning models, especially natural language processing models, can comprehend the semantics of binary code. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying binary operators which uses a sequence-aware model and a structure-aware model to model binary operators. It combines CNN semantics and Transformer semantics for classification. The evaluation shows that our method can achieve good performance in binary operator classification.",

      "abstract": "Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) has become a widespread paradigm, making even the most complex Machine Learning models available for clients via, e.g., a pay-per-query principle. This allows users to avoid time-consuming processes of data collection, hyperparameter tuning, and model training. However, by giving their customers access to the (predictions of their) models, MLaaS providers endanger their intellectual property such as sensitive training data, optimised hyperparameters, or learned model parameters. In some cases, adversaries can create a copy of the model with (almost) identical behaviour using the the prediction labels only. While many variants of this attack have been described, only scattered defence strategies that address isolated threats have been proposed. To arrive at a comprehensive understanding why these attacks are successful and how they could be holistically defended against, a thorough systematisation of the field of model stealing is necessary. We address this by categorising and comparing model stealing attacks, assessing their performance, and exploring corresponding defence techniques in different settings. We propose a taxonomy for attack and defence approaches and provide guidelines on how to select the right attack or defence strategy based on the goal and available resources. Finally, we analyse which defences are rendered less effective by current attack strategies.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models deployed as a service (MLaaS) are susceptible to model stealing attacks, where an adversary attempts to steal the model within a restricted access framework. While existing attacks demonstrate near-perfect clone-model performance using softmax predictions of the classification network, most of the APIs allow access to only the top-1 labels. In this work, we show that it is indeed possible to steal Machine Learning models by accessing only top-1 predictions (Hard Label setting) as well, without access to model gradients (Black-Box setting) or even the training dataset (Data-Free setting) within a low query budget. We propose a novel GAN-based framework11Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/dfms-hl that trains the student and generator in tandem to steal the model effectively while overcoming the challenge of the hard label setting by utilizing gradients of the clone network as a proxy to the victim's gradients. We propose to overcome the large query costs associated with a typical Data-Free setting by utilizing publicly available (potentially unrelated) datasets as a weak image prior. We additionally show that even in the absence of such data, it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art results within a low query budget using synthetically crafted samples. We are the first to demonstrate the scalability of Model Stealing in a restricted access setting on a 100 class dataset as well.",

      "abstract": "Self-supervised models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning (ML) since they reduce the need for expensively labeled data. Because of their versatility in downstream applications, they are increasingly used as a service exposed via public APIs. At the same time, these encoder models are particularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high dimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain undefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on supervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership in the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an encoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently trained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As part of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen encoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without involving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and distance measurements. Our extensive empirical results in the vision domain demonstrate that dataset inference is a promising direction for defending self-supervised models against model stealing.",

      "abstract": "Inversion of large-scale time-domain transient electromagnetic (TEM) surveys is computationally expensive and time-consuming. The calculation of partial derivatives for the Jacobian matrix is by far the most computationally intensive task, as this requires calculation of a significant number of forward responses. We propose to accelerate the inversion process by predicting partial derivatives using an artificial neural network. Network training data for resistivity models for a broad range of geological settings are generated by computing partial derivatives as symmetric differences between two forward responses. Given that certain applications have larger tolerances for modeling inaccuracy and varying degrees of flexibility throughout the different phases of interpretation, we present four inversion schemes that provide a tunable balance between computational time and inversion accuracy when modeling TEM datasets. We improve speed and maintain accuracy with a hybrid framework, where the neural network derivatives are used initially and switched to full numerical derivatives in the final iterations. We also present a full neural network solution where neural network forward and derivatives are used throughout the inversion. In a least-squares inversion framework, a speedup factor exceeding 70 is obtained on the calculation of derivatives, and the inversion process is expedited ~36 times when the full neural network solution is used. Field examples show that the full nonlinear inversion and the hybrid approach gives identical results, whereas the full neural network inversion results in higher deviation but provides a reasonable indication about the overall subsurface geology.",

The proposed method does not require any training data or construction of a surrogate model before the optimization phase. Instead, the NN surrogate model is built from the initial population in the optimization process, and then it is sequentially updated with high-ranking individuals. All individuals were evaluated using the surrogate model. Based on this evaluation, high-ranking individuals are reevaluated using high-fidelity electromagnetic field computation. The suppression of the execution of expensive field computations effectively reduces the computing costs. It is shown that the proposed method works two to four times faster, maintaining optimization performance than the original method that does not use surrogate models.",

      "abstract": "Super-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) electromagnetic (EM) inversion for microwave human brain imaging is a typical high contrast EM inverse problem and requires huge computational costs. This work proposes a hybrid neural network electromagnetic inversion scheme (HNNEMIS) which contains shallow and deep neural networks to alleviate the required huge computational costs and solve this high contrast inverse problem. In the proposed scheme, semi-join back propagation neural network (SJ-BPNN) is employed to nonlinearly map the measured scattered electric field to two output channels, namely the permittivity and conductivity of scatterers, respectively. Such a semi-join strategy decreases the computational burden in training and testing processes. Then, a deep learning technique, termed U-Net, is employed to further enhance the imaging quality of the output from SJ-BPNN. To decrease the training cost and make neural networks fast convergent for human brain inversion, a novel training dataset construction strategy which contains the characteristics of human brain is also proposed. Noise-free and noisy numerical examples demonstrate that HNNEMIS has superior super-resolution inversion capabilities for human brain imaging.",

These techniques have a great many applications in all areas of the modern digital economy and artificial intelligence. More importantly, these methods are essential for a rapidly increasing number of safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and intelligent defense systems. However, emerging adversarial learning attacks pose a serious security threat that greatly undermines further such systems. The latter are classified into four types, evasion (manipulating data to avoid detection), poisoning (injection malicious training samples to disrupt retraining), model stealing (extraction), and inference (leveraging over-generalization on training data). Understanding this type of attacks is a crucial first step for the development of effective countermeasures.

Consequently, the model value raises incentive for adversary to steal the model for profits, such as the representative model extraction attack.

In this paper, we take the first step to uncover the root cause of such Arch-hints and summarize the principles to identify them. We then apply these principles to emerging Unified Memory (UM) management system and identify three new Arch-hints caused by UM's unique data movement patterns. We then develop a new extraction attack, UMProbe. We also create the first DNN benchmark suite in UM and utilize the benchmark suite to evaluate UMProbe. Our evaluation shows that UMProbe can extract the layer sequence with an accuracy of 95% for almost all victim test models, which thus calls for more attention to the DNN security in UM system.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) with incomparably advanced performance have been extensively applied in diverse fields (e.g., image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition). Training a high-performance DNN model requires a lot of training data and intellectual and computing resources, which bring a high cost to the model owners. Therefore, illegal model abuse (model theft, derivation, resale or redistribution, etc.) seriously infringes model owners\u2019 legitimate rights and interests. Watermarking is considered the main topic of DNN ownership protection. However, almost all existing watermarking works apply solely to image data. They do not trace the unique infringing model, and the adversary easily detects these ownership verification samples (trigger set) simultaneously. This paper introduces TADW, a dynamic watermarking scheme with tracking and antidetection abilities in the deep learning (DL) textual domain. Specifically, we propose a new approach to construct trigger set samples for antidetection and innovatively design a mapping algorithm that assigns a unique serial number (SN) to every watermarked model. Furthermore, we implement and detailedly evaluate TADW on 2 benchmark datasets and 3 popular DNNs. Experiment results show that TADW can successfully verify the ownership of the target model at a less than 0.5% accuracy cost and identify unique infringing models. In addition, TADW is excellently robust against different model modifications and can serve numerous users.",

      "abstract": "With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in different domains, such as computer vision, healthcare, social media, and defense. The hardware-level architecture of a DNN can be built using an in-memory computing-based design, which is loaded with the weights of a well-trained DNN model. However, such hardware-based DNN systems are vulnerable to model stealing attacks where an attacker reverse-engineers (REs) and extracts the weights of the DNN model. In this work, we propose an energy-efficient defense technique that combines a ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET)-based reconfigurable physically unclonable function (PUF) with an in-memory FeFET XNOR to thwart model stealing attacks. We leverage the inherent stochasticity in the FE domains to build a PUF that helps to corrupt the neural network\u2019s (NN) weights when an adversarial attack is detected. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed defense scheme by performing experiments on graph-NNs (GNNs), a particular type of DNN. The proposed defense scheme is a first of its kind that evaluates the security of GNNs. We investigate the effect of corrupting the weights on different layers of the GNN on the accuracy degradation of the graph classification application for two specific error models of corrupting the FeFET-based PUFs and five different bioinformatics datasets. We demonstrate that our approach successfully degrades the inference accuracy of the graph classification by corrupting any layer of the GNN after a small rewrite pulse.",

      "abstract": "Today\u2019s intelligent services are built on well-trained deep neural network (DNN) models, which usually require large private datasets along with a high cost for model training. It consequently makes the model providers cherish the pre-trained DNN models and only distribute them to authorized users. However, malicious users can steal these valuable models for abuse, illegal copy and redistribution. Attackers can also extract private features from even authorized models to leak partial training datasets. They both violate privacy. Existing techniques from secure community attempt to avoid parameter leakage during model authorization but yet cannot solve privacy issues sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving model authorization approach, AgAuth, to resist the aforementioned privacy threats. We devise a novel scheme called Information-Agnostic Conversion (IAC) for forwarding procedure to eliminate residual features in model parameters. Based on it, we then propose Inference-on-Ciphertext (CiFer) mechanism for DNN reasoning, which includes three stages in each forwarding. The Encrypt phase first converts the proprietary model parameters to demonstrate uniform distribution. The Forward stage per-forms forwarding function without decryption at authorized side. Specifically, this stage just computes over ciphertext. The Decrypt phase finally recovers the information-agnostic outputs to informative output tensor for real-world services. In addition, we implement a prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance.

      "abstract": "Model extraction attacks pose a threat to the security of ML models and to the privacy of the data used for training. Previous research has shown that such attacks can be either monetarily motivated to gain an edge over competitors or maliciously in order to mount subsequent attacks on the extracted model. In this paper, recent advances in the field of transformers are exploited to propose an attack tailored to the task of image classification that allows stealing complex convolutional neural network models without any knowledge of their architecture. The attack was performed on a range of datasets and target architectures to evaluate the robustness of the proposed attack. With only 100k queries, we were able to recover up to 99.2% of the black-box target network's accuracy on the test set. We conclude that it is possible to effectively steal complex neural networks with relatively little expertise and conventional means \u2013 even without knowledge of the target's architecture. Recently proposed defences have also been examined for their effectiveness in preventing the attack proposed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Several companies often safeguard their trained deep models (i.e. details of architecture, learnt weights, training details etc.) from third-party users by exposing them only as \u2018black boxes' through APIs. Moreover, they may not even provide access to the training data due to proprietary reasons or sensitivity concerns. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism for black box models against adversarial attacks in a data-free set up. We construct synthetic data via a generative model and train surrogate network using model stealing techniques. To minimize adversarial contamination on perturbed samples, we propose \u2018wavelet noise remover' (WNR) that performs discrete wavelet decomposition on input images and carefully select only a few important coefficients determined by our \u2018wavelet coefficient selection module' (WCSM). To recover the high-frequency content of the image after noise removal via WNR, we further train a \u2018regenerator' network with an objective to retrieve the coefficients such that the reconstructed image yields similar to original predictions on the surrogate model. At test time, WNR combined with trained regenerator network is prepended to the black box network, resulting in a high boost in adversarial accuracy. Our method improves the adversarial accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 38.98% and 32.01% against the state-of-the-art Auto Attack compared to baseline, even when the attacker uses surrogate architecture (Alexnet-half and Alexnet) similar to the black box architecture (Alexnet) with same model stealing strategy as defender.",

      "abstract": "Recent work has highlighted the risks of intellectual property (IP) piracy of deep learning (DL) models from the side-channel leakage of DL hardware accelerators. In response, to provide side-channel leakage resiliency to DL hardware accelerators, several approaches have been proposed, mainly borrowed from the methodologies devised for cryptographic implementations. Therefore, as expected, the same challenges posed by the complex design of such countermeasures should be dealt with. This is despite the fact that fundamental cryptographic approaches, specifically secure and private function evaluation, could potentially improve the robustness against side-channel leakage. To examine this and weigh the costs and benefits, we introduce hardware garbled NN (HWGN2), a DL hardware accelerator implemented on FPGA. HWGN2 also provides NN designers with the flexibility to protect their IP in real-time applications, where hardware resources are heavily constrained, through a hardware-communication cost trade-off. Concretely, we apply garbled circuits, implemented using a MIPS architecture that achieves up to 62.5x fewer logical and 66x less memory utilization than the state-of-the-art approaches at the price of communication overhead. Further, the side-channel resiliency of HWGN2 is demonstrated by employing the test vector leakage assessment (TVLA) test against both power and electromagnetic side-channels. This is in addition to the inherent feature of HWGN2: it ensures the privacy of users' input, including the architecture of NNs. We also demonstrate a natural extension to the malicious security modeljust as a by-product of our implementation.",

Firstly, we convert some training images into grayscale images as embedding and inject them to the training set.

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has gained popularity in network intrusion detection, due to its strong capability of recognizing subtle differences between normal and malicious network activities. Although a variety of methods have been designed to leverage DL models for security protection, whether these systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) is unknown. In this article, we design a novel adversarial attack against DL-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in the Internet-of-Things environment, with only black-box accesses to the DL model in such NIDS. We introduce two techniques: 1) model extraction is adopted to replicate the black-box model with a small amount of training data and 2) a saliency map is then used to disclose the impact of each packet attribute on the detection results, and the most critical features. This enables us to efficiently generate AEs using conventional methods. With these tehniques, we successfully compromise one state-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune: the adversary only needs to modify less than 0.005% of bytes in the malicious packets to achieve an average 94.31% attack success rate.",

As a result, we lack a comprehensive picture of the risks caused by the attacks, e.g., the different scenarios they can be applied to, the common factors that influence their performance, the relationship among them, or the effectiveness of possible defenses. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a first-of-its-kind holistic risk assessment of different inference attacks against machine learning models. We concentrate on four attacks -- namely, membership inference, model inversion, attribute inference, and model stealing -- and establish a threat model taxonomy. Our extensive experimental evaluation, run on five model architectures and four image datasets, shows that the complexity of the training dataset plays an important role with respect to the attack's performance, while the effectiveness of model stealing and membership inference attacks are negatively correlated. We also show that defenses like DP-SGD and Knowledge Distillation can only mitigate some of the inference attacks. Our analysis relies on a modular re-usable software, ML-Doctor, which enables ML model owners to assess the risks of deploying their models, and equally serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners.",

      "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) tasks, ranging from text classification to text generation, have been revolutionised by the pretrained language models, such as BERT. This allows corporations to easily build powerful APIs by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT models for downstream tasks. However, when a fine-tuned BERT model is deployed as a service, it may suffer from different attacks launched by the malicious users. In this work, we first present how an adversary can steal a BERT-based API service (the victim/target model) on multiple benchmark datasets with limited prior knowledge and queries. We further show that the extracted model can lead to highly transferable adversarial attacks against the victim model. Our studies indicate that the potential vulnerabilities of BERT-based API services still hold, even when there is an architectural mismatch between the victim model and the attack model. Finally, we investigate two defence strategies to protect the victim model, and find that unless the performance of the victim model is sacrificed, both model extraction and adversarial transferability can effectively compromise the target models.",

This type of risk has attracted attention in image and text classification, but to our knowledge not in recommender systems. We argue that sequential recommender systems are subject to unique vulnerabilities due to the specific autoregressive regimes used to train them. Unlike many existing recommender attackers, which assume the dataset used to train the victim model is exposed to attackers, we consider a data-free setting, where training data are not accessible. Under this setting, we propose an API-based model extraction method via limited-budget synthetic data generation and knowledge distillation. We investigate state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendation and show their vulnerability under model extraction and downstream attacks. We perform attacks in two stages. (1) Model extraction: given different types of synthetic data and their labels retrieved from a black-box recommender, we extract the black-box model to a white-box model via distillation. (2) Downstream attacks: we attack the black-box model with adversarial samples generated by the white-box recommender. Experiments show the effectiveness of our data-free model extraction and downstream attacks on sequential recommenders in both profile pollution and data poisoning settings.",

      "abstract": "Many adversarial attacks have been proposed to investigate the security issues of deep neural networks. In the black-box setting, current model stealing attacks train a substitute model to counterfeit the functionality of the target model. However, the training requires querying the target model. Consequently, the query complexity remains high, and such attacks can be defended easily. This study aims to train a generalized substitute model called \"Simulator\", which can mimic the functionality of any unknown target model. To this end, we build the training data with the form of multiple tasks by collecting query sequences generated during the attacks of various existing networks. The learning process uses a mean square error-based knowledge-distillation loss in the meta-learning to minimize the difference between the Simulator and the sampled networks. The meta-gradients of this loss are then computed and accumulated from multiple tasks to update the Simulator and subsequently improve generalization. When attacking a target model that is unseen in training, the trained Simulator can accurately simulate its functionality using its limited feedback. As a result, a large fraction of queries can be transferred to the Simulator, thereby reducing query complexity. Results of the comprehensive experiments conducted using the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces query complexity by several orders of magnitude compared to the baseline method.

      "abstract": "Public intelligent services enabled by machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to model extraction attacks that can steal confidential information of the learning models through public queries. Though there are some protection options such as differential privacy (DP) and monitoring, which are considered promising techniques to mitigate this attack, we still find that the vulnerability persists. In this article, we propose an adaptive query-flooding parameter duplication (QPD) attack. The adversary can infer the model information with black-box access and no prior knowledge of any model parameters or training data via QPD. We also develop a defense strategy using DP called monitoring-based DP (MDP) against this new attack. In MDP, we first propose a novel real-time model extraction status assessment scheme called Monitor to evaluate the situation of the model. Then, we design a method to guide the differential privacy budget allocation called APBA adaptively. Finally, all DP-based defenses with MDP could dynamically adjust the amount of noise added in the model response according to the result from Monitor and effectively defends the QPD attack. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate and compare the QPD attack and MDP defense performance on real-world models with DP and monitoring protection.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance in various real-world applications. Building a powerful GNN model is not a trivial task, as it requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise. Moreover, with the development of adversarial attacks, e.g., model stealing attacks, GNNs raise challenges to model authentication. To avoid copyright infringement on GNNs, verifying the ownership of the GNN models is necessary.This paper presents a watermarking framework for GNNs for both graph and node classification tasks. We 1) design two strategies to generate watermarked data for the graph classification task and one for the node classification task, 2) embed the watermark into the host model through training to obtain the watermarked GNN model, and 3) verify the ownership of the suspicious model in a black-box setting. The experiments show that our framework can verify the ownership of GNN models with a very high probability (up to 99%) for both tasks. We also explore our watermarking mechanism against an adaptive attacker with access to partial knowledge of the watermarked data. Finally, we experimentally show that our watermarking approach is robust against a state-of-the-art model extraction technique and four state-of-the-art defenses against backdoor attacks.",

      "title": "Preventing DNN Model IP Theft via Hardware Obfuscation",
      "abstract": "Training accurate deep learning (DL) models require large amounts of training data, significant work in labeling the data, considerable computing resources, and substantial domain expertise. In short, they are expensive to develop. Hence, protecting these models, which are valuable storehouses of intellectual properties (IP), against model stealing/cloning attacks is of paramount importance. Today\u2019s mobile processors feature Neural Processing Units (NPUs) to accelerate the execution of DL models. DL models executing on NPUs are vulnerable to hyperparameter extraction via side-channel attacks and model parameter theft via bus monitoring attacks. This paper presents a novel solution to defend against DL IP theft in NPUs during model distribution and deployment/execution via lightweight, keyed model obfuscation scheme. Unauthorized use of such models results in inaccurate classification. In addition, we present an ideal end-to-end deep learning trusted system composed of: 1) model distribution via hardware root-of-trust and public-key cryptography infrastructure (PKI) and 2) model execution via low-latency memory encryption. We demonstrate that our proposed obfuscation solution achieves IP protection objectives without requiring specialized training or sacrificing the model\u2019s accuracy. In addition, the proposed obfuscation mechanism preserves the output class distribution while degrading the model\u2019s accuracy for unauthorized parties, covering any evidence of a hacked model.",

      "abstract": "Although neural networks have been applied in many fields since they were first introduced, the feasibility of applying it to predict the solution of Maxwell's equations remains open. In this letter, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing the long- and short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to solve the time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) forward problems. With ground truth datasets being generated from the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, a novel LSTM-TDEM model structure is proposed, and trained by a new feasible algorithm specifically designed for time-domain simulation. The strong approximation ability of the LSTM-TDEM method can accurately predict the electromagnetic field distributions for topologies of different geometries, materials, and excitations at different locations. The effectiveness of the proposed LSTM-TDEM method has been validated by several numerical experiments. The average relative error can be as small as 0.63% for 2-D case and 0.35% for 3-D case. It is worth noting that the training data are only 5% (198/4087) and 30% (660/2189) in 2-D and 3-D cases, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the traditional FDTD method, the proposed method greatly reduces the calculation time, with its speedup ratio more than 1800 and 44\u00a0000 times over the FDTD method in 2-D and 3-D cases, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Conventional interpretation of airborne electromagnetic data has been conducted by solving the inverse problem. However, with recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques, a one-dimensional (1D) deep neural network inversion that predicts a 1D resistivity model using multi-frequency vertical magnetic fields and sensor height information at one location has been applied. Nevertheless, bacause the final interpretation of this 1D approach relies on connecting 1D resistivity models, 1D ML interpretation has low accuracy for the estimation of an isolated anomaly, as in conventional 1D inversion. Thus, we propose a two-dimensional (2D) interpretation technique that can overcome the limitations of 1D interpretation, and consider spatial continuity by using a recurrent neural network (RNN). We generated various 2D resistivity models, calculated the ratio of primary and induced secondary magnetic fields of vertical direction in ppm scale using vertical magnetic dipole source, and then trained the RNN using the resistivity models and the corresponding electromagnetic (EM) responses. To verify the validity of 2D RNN inversion, we applied the trained RNN to synthetic and field data. Through application of the field data, we demonstrated that the design of the training dataset is crucial to improve prediction performance in a 2D RNN inversion. In addition, we investigated changes in the RNN inversion results of field data dependent on the data preprocessing. We demonstrated that using two types of data, logarithmic transformed data and linear scale data, which having different patterns of input information can enhance the prediction performance of the EM inversion results.",

      "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) represents an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm that automatically searches for models tailored to given tasks, which greatly simplifies the development of ML systems and propels the trend of ML democratization. Yet, little is known about the potential security risks incurred by NAS, which is concerning given the increasing use of NAS-generated models in critical domains. This work represents a solid initial step towards bridging the gap. Through an extensive empirical study of 10 popular NAS methods, we show that compared with their manually designed counterparts, NAS-generated models tend to suffer greater vulnerability to various malicious attacks (e.g., adversarial evasion, model poisoning, and functionality stealing). Further, with both empirical and analytical evidence, we provide possible explanations for such phenomena: given the prohibitive search space and training cost, most NAS methods favor models that converge fast at early training stages; this preference results in architectural properties associated with attack vulnerability (e.g., high loss smoothness and low gradient variance). Our findings not only reveal the relationships between model characteristics and attack vulnerability but also suggest the inherent connections underlying different attacks. Finally, we discuss potential remedies to mitigate such drawbacks, including increasing cell depth and suppressing skip connects, which lead to several promising research directions.",

      "abstract": "The collection and availability of big data, combined with advances in pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, XLNET, etc), have revolutionized the predictive performance of modern natural language processing tasks, ranging from text classification to text generation. This allows corporations to provide machine learning as a service (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as APIs. However, BERT-based APIs have exhibited a series of security and privacy vulnerabilities. For example, prior work has exploited the security issues of the BERT-based APIs through the adversarial examples crafted by the extracted model. However, the privacy leakage problems of the BERT-based APIs through the extracted model have not been well studied. On the other hand, due to the high capacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be overlearned, but what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model remains unknown. In this work, we bridge this gap by first presenting an effective model extraction attack, where the adversary can practically steal a BERT-based API (the target/victim model) by only querying a limited number of queries. We further develop an effective attribute inference attack which can infer the sensitive attribute of the training data used by the BERT-based APIs. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various realistic settings validate the potential vulnerabilities of BERT-based APIs. Moreover, we demonstrate that two promising defense methods become ineffective against our attacks, which calls for more effective defense methods.",

      "title": "Timing Black-Box Attacks: Crafting Adversarial Examples through Timing Leaks against DNNs on Embedded Devices",
      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied to various industries. In particular, DNNs on embedded devices have attracted considerable interest because they allow real-time and distributed processing on site. However, adversarial examples (AEs), which add small perturbations to the input data of DNNs to cause misclassification, are serious threats to DNNs. In this paper, a novel black-box attack is proposed to craft AEs based only on processing time, i.e., the side-channel leaks from DNNs on embedded devices. Unlike several existing black-box attacks that utilize output probability, the proposed attack exploits the relationship between the number of activated nodes and processing time without using training data, model architecture, parameters, substitute models, or output probability. The perturbations for AEs are determined by the differential processing time based on the input data of the DNNs in the proposed attack. The experimental results show that the AEs of the proposed attack effectively cause an increase in the number of activated nodes and the misclassification of one of the incorrect labels against the DNNs on a microcontroller unit. Moreover, these results indicate that the attack can evade gradient-masking and confidence reduction countermeasures, which conceal the output probability, to prevent the crafting of AEs against several black-box attacks. Finally, the countermeasures against the attack are implemented and evaluated to clarify that the implementation of an activation function with data-dependent timing leaks is the cause of the proposed attack.",

Despite extensive attacking efforts which rely on white-box or gray-box access, how to perform attacks with black-box access continues to be elusive. Aspiring to fill this gap, we move one step further and present ML-Stealer that can steal the functionality of any type of ML models with mere black-box access. With two algorithm designs, namely, synthetic data generation and replica model construction, ML-Stealer can construct a deep neural network (DNN)-based replica model which has the similar prediction functionality to the victim ML model. ML-Stealer does not require any knowledge about the victim model, nor does it enforce the access to statistical information or samples of the victim's training data. Experiment results demonstrate that ML-Stealer can achieve the consistent prediction results with the victim model of an averaged testing accuracy of 85.6%, and up to 93.6% at best.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models are typically made available to potential client users via inference APIs. Model extraction attacks occur when a malicious client uses information gleaned from queries to the inference API of a victim model $F_V$ to build a surrogate model $F_A$ with comparable functionality. Recent research has shown successful model extraction of image classification, and natural language processing models. In this paper, we show the first model extraction attack against real-world generative adversarial network (GAN) image translation models. We present a framework for conducting such attacks, and show that an adversary can successfully extract functional surrogate models by querying $F_V$ using data from the same domain as the training data for $F_V$. The adversary need not know $F_V$'s architecture or any other information about it beyond its intended task. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attacks using three different instances of two popular categories of image translation: (1) Selfie-to-Anime and (2) Monet-to-Photo (image style transfer), and (3) Super-Resolution (super resolution). Using standard performance metrics for GANs, we show that our attacks are effective. Furthermore, we conducted a large scale (125 participants) user study on Selfie-to-Anime and Monet-to-Photo to show that human perception of the images produced by $F_V$ and $F_A$ can be considered equivalent, within an equivalence bound of Cohen's d = 0.3. Finally, we show that existing defenses against model extraction attacks (watermarking, adversarial examples, poisoning) do not extend to image translation models.",

      "abstract": "Graph data, such as social networks and chemical networks, contains a wealth of information that can help to build powerful applications. To fully unleash the power of graph data, a family of machine learning models, namely graph neural networks (GNNs), is introduced. Empirical results show that GNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. \nGraph data is the key to the success of GNNs. High-quality graph is expensive to collect and often contains sensitive information, such as social relations. Various research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to attacks against their training data. Most of these models focus on data from the Euclidean space, such as images and texts. Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to the security and privacy risks of graph data used to train GNNs. \nIn this paper, we aim at filling the gap by proposing the first link stealing attacks against graph neural networks. Given a black-box access to a GNN model, the goal of an adversary is to infer whether there exists a link between any pair of nodes in the graph used to train the model. We propose a threat model to systematically characterize the adversary's background knowledge along three dimensions. By combination, we obtain a comprehensive taxonomy of 8 different link stealing attacks. We propose multiple novel methods to realize these attacks. Extensive experiments over 8 real-world datasets show that our attacks are effective at inferring links, e.g., AUC (area under the ROC curve) is above 0.95 in multiple cases.",

In this paper, we introduce an effective and efficient black-box attack methodology that extracts largescale DNN models from cloud-based platforms with near-perfect performance. In comparison to existing attack methods, we significantly reduce the number of queries required to steal the target model by incorporating several novel algorithms, including active learning, transfer learning, and adversarial attacks. During our experimental evaluations, we validate our proposed model for conducting theft attacks on various commercialized MLaaS platforms hosted by Microsoft, Face++, IBM, Google and Clarifai. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can easily reveal/steal large-scale DNN models from these cloud platforms. The proposed attack method can also be used to accurately evaluates the robustness of DNN based MLaaS classifiers against theft attacks.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning has been pervasively used in a wide range of applications due to its technical breakthroughs in recent years. It has demonstrated significant success in dealing with various complex problems, and shows capabilities close to humans or even beyond humans. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to various attacks, which will compromise the security of the models themselves and the application systems. Moreover, such attacks are stealthy due to the unexplained nature of the deep learning models. In this survey, we systematically analyze the security issues of machine learning, focusing on existing attacks on machine learning systems, corresponding defenses or secure learning techniques, and security evaluation methods. Instead of focusing on one stage or one type of attack, this paper covers all the aspects of machine learning security from the training phase to the test phase. First, the machine learning model in the presence of adversaries is presented, and the reasons why machine learning can be attacked are analyzed. Then, the machine learning security-related issues are classified into five categories: training set poisoning; backdoors in the training set; adversarial example attacks; model theft; recovery of sensitive training data. The threat models, attack approaches, and defense techniques are analyzed systematically. To demonstrate that these threats are real concerns in the physical world, we also reviewed the attacks in real-world conditions. Several suggestions on security evaluations of machine learning systems are also provided. Last, future directions for machine learning security are also presented.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has gained tremendous success and great popularity in the past few years. However, deep learning systems are suffering several inherent weaknesses, which can threaten the security of learning models. Deep learning\u2019s wide use further magnifies the impact and consequences. To this end, lots of research has been conducted with the purpose of exhaustively identifying intrinsic weaknesses and subsequently proposing feasible mitigation. Yet few are clear about how these weaknesses are incurred and how effective these attack approaches are in assaulting deep learning. In order to unveil the security weaknesses and aid in the development of a robust deep learning system, we undertake an investigation on attacks towards deep learning, and analyze these attacks to conclude some findings in multiple views. In particular, we focus on four types of attacks associated with security threats of deep learning: model extraction attack, model inversion attack, poisoning attack and adversarial attack. For each type of attack, we construct its essential workflow as well as adversary capabilities and attack goals. Pivot metrics are devised for comparing the attack approaches, by which we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. From the analysis, we have identified significant and indispensable factors in an attack vector, e.g., how to reduce queries to target models, what distance should be used for measuring perturbation. We shed light on 18 findings covering these approaches\u2019 merits and demerits, success probability, deployment complexity and prospects. Moreover, we discuss other potential security weaknesses and possible mitigation which can inspire relevant research in this area.",

      "title": "WAFFLE: Watermarking in Federated Learning",
      "abstract": "Federated learning is a distributed learning technique where machine learning models are trained on client devices in which the local training data resides. The training is coordinated via a central server which is, typically, controlled by the intended owner of the resulting model. By avoiding the need to transport the training data to the central server, federated learning improves privacy and efficiency. But it raises the risk of model theft by clients because the resulting model is available on every client device. Even if the application software used for local training may attempt to prevent direct access to the model, a malicious client may bypass any such restrictions by reverse engineering the application software. Watermarking is a well-known deterrence method against model theft by providing the means for model owners to demonstrate ownership of their models. Several recent deep neural network (DNN) watermarking techniques use backdooring: training the models with additional mislabeled data. Backdooring requires full access to the training data and control of the training process. This is feasible when a single party trains the model in a centralized manner, but not in a federated learning setting where the training process and training data are distributed among several client devices. In this paper, we present WAFFLE, the first approach to watermark DNN models trained using federated learning. It introduces a retraining step at the server after each aggregation of local models into the global model. We show that WAFFLE efficiently embeds a resilient watermark into models incurring only negligible degradation in test accuracy (-0.17%), and does not require access to training data. We also introduce a novel technique to generate the backdoor used as a watermark. It outperforms prior techniques, imposing no communication, and low computational (+3.2%) overhead11The research report version of this paper is also available in https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07298, and the code for reproducing our work can be found at https://github.com/ssg-research/WAFFLE.",

      "abstract": "Federated learning aggregates data from multiple sources while protecting privacy, which makes it possible to train efficient models in real scenes. However, although federated learning uses encrypted security aggregation, its decentralised nature makes it vulnerable to malicious attackers. A deliberate attacker can subtly control one or more participants and upload malicious model parameter updates, but the aggregation server cannot detect it due to encrypted privacy protection. Based on these problems, we find a practical and novel security risk in the design of federal learning. We propose an attack for conspired malicious participants to adjust the training data strategically so that the weight of a certain dimension in the aggregation model will rise or fall with a pattern. The trend of weights or parameters in the aggregation model forms meaningful signals, which is the risk of information leakage. The leakage is exposed to other participants in this federation but only available for participants who reach an agreement with the malicious participant, i.e., the receiver must be able to understand patterns of changes in weights. The attack effect is evaluated and verified on open-source code and data sets.",

      "abstract": "Modern geosteering is heavily dependent on real-time interpretation of deep electromagnetic (EM) measurements. We have developed a methodology to construct a deep neural network (DNN) model trained to reproduce a full set of extra-deep EM logs consisting of 22 measurements per logging position. The model is trained in a 1D layered environment consisting of up to seven layers with different resistivity values. A commercial simulator provided by a tool vendor is used to generate a training data set. The data set size is limited because the simulator provided by the vendor is optimized for sequential execution. Therefore, we design a training data set that embraces the geologic rules and geosteering specifics supported by the forward model. We use this data set to produce an EM simulator based on a DNN without access to the proprietary information about the EM tool configuration or the original simulator source code. Despite using a relatively small training set size, the resulting DNN forward model is quite accurate for the considered examples: a multilayer synthetic case and a section of a published historical operation from the Goliat field. The observed average evaluation time of 0.15\u00a0ms per logging position makes it also suitable for future use as part of evaluation-hungry statistical and/or Monte Carlo inversion algorithms within geosteering workflows.",

      "abstract": "We present a neural network architecture to determine the volume and complex permittivity of grain stored in metal bins. The neural networks output the grain height, cone angle and complex permittivity of the grain, using the input of experimental field data ( $S$ -parameters) from an electromagnetic imaging system consisting of 24 transceivers installed in the bin. Key for practical applications, the neural networks are trained on synthetic data sets but generate the parametric information using experimental data as input, without the use of calibration objects or open-short-load measurements. To accomplish this, we formulate a data normalization scheme that enables the use of a loss function that directly compares measured $S$ -parameters and simulation model fields. The normalization strategy and the ability to train on synthetic data means we do not need to collect experimental training data. We demonstrate the applicability of this synthetically trained neural network to experimental data from two different bin geometries, and discuss the ability of these neural networks to successfully infer parameters that can be used for grain inventory management. Our neural-network-based approach enables rapid inference, providing a more cost-effective long-term solution than existing optimization-based parametric inversion methods.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models have been widely deployed in many real-world tasks. When a non-expert data holder wants to use a third-party machine learning service for model training, it is critical to preserve the confidentiality of the training data. In this paper, we for the first time explore the potential privacy leakage in a scenario that a malicious ML provider offers data holder customized training code including model compression which is essential in practical deployment The provider is unable to access the training process hosted by the secured third party, but could inquire models when they are released in public. As a result, adversary can extract sensitive training data with high quality even from these deeply compressed models that are tailored for resource-limited devices. Our investigation shows that existing compressions like quantization, can serve as a defense against such an attack, by degrading the model accuracy and memorized data quality simultaneously. To overcome this defense, we take an initial attempt to design a simple but stealthy quantized correlation encoding attack flow from an adversary perspective. Three integrated components-data pre-processing, layer-wise data-weight correlation regularization, data-aware quantization, are developed accordingly. Extensive experimental results show that our framework can preserve the evasiveness and effectiveness of stealing data from compressed models.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML), and deep learning in particular, have become a critical workload as they are becoming increasingly applied at the core of a wide range of application spaces. Computer systems, from the architecture up, have been impacted by ML in two primary directions: (1) ML is an increasingly important computing workload, with new accelerators and systems targeted to support both training and inference at scale; and (2) ML supporting computer system decisions, both during design and run times, with new machine learning based algorithms controlling systems to optimize their performance, reliability and robustness. In this paper, we will explore the intersection of security, ML and computing systems, identifying both security challenges and opportunities. Machine learning systems are vulnerable to new attacks including adversarial attacks crafted to fool a classifier to the attacker's advantage, membership inference attacks attempting to compromise the privacy of the training data, and model extraction attacks seeking to recover the hyperparameters of a (secret) model. Architecture can be a target of these attacks when supporting ML (or is supported by ML), but also provides an opportunity to develop defenses against them, which we will illustrate with three examples from our recent work. First, we show how ML based hardware malware detectors can be attacked with adversarial perturbations to the Malware and how we can develop detectors that resist these attacks. Second, we show an example of microarchitectural side channel attacks that can be used to extract the secret parameters of a neural network and potential defenses against it. Finally, we discuss how hardware and systems can be used to make ML more robust against adversarial and other attacks.",

      "abstract": "Public intelligent services enabled by machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to model extraction attacks that can steal confidential information of the learning models through public queries. Though there are some protection options such as differential privacy (DP) and monitoring, which are considered promising techniques to mitigate this attack, we still find that the vulnerability persists. In this paper, we propose an adaptive query-flooding parameter duplication (QPD) attack. The adversary can infer the model information with black-box access and no prior knowledge of any model parameters or training data via QPD. We also develop a defense strategy using DP called monitoring-based DP (MDP) against this new attack. In MDP, we first propose a novel real-time model extraction status assessment scheme called Monitor to evaluate the situation of the model. Then, we design a method to guide the differential privacy budget allocation called APBA adaptively. Finally, all DP-based defenses with MDP could dynamically adjust the amount of noise added in the model response according to the result from Monitor and effectively defends the QPD attack. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate and compare the QPD attack and MDP defense performance on real-world models with DP and monitoring protection.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of deep learning has drawn attention to the privacy protection of sensitive data. Various privacy threats have been presented, where an adversary can steal model owners' private data. Meanwhile, countermeasures have also been introduced to achieve privacy-preserving deep learning. However, most studies only focused on data privacy during training, and ignored privacy during inference. In this paper, we devise a new set of attacks to compromise the inference data privacy in collaborative deep learning systems. Specifically, when a deep neural network and the corresponding inference task are split and distributed to different participants, one malicious participant can accurately recover an arbitrary input fed into this system, even if he has no access to other participants' data or computations, or to prediction APIs to query this system. We evaluate our attacks under different settings, models and datasets, to show their effectiveness and generalization. We also study the characteristics of deep learning models that make them susceptible to such inference privacy threats. This provides insights and guidelines to develop more privacy-preserving collaborative systems and algorithms.",

Existing defenses take a passive role against stealing attacks, such as by truncating predicted information. We find such passive defenses ineffective against DNN stealing attacks. In this paper, we propose the first defense which actively perturbs predictions targeted at poisoning the training objective of the attacker. We find our defense effective across a wide range of challenging datasets and DNN model stealing attacks, and additionally outperforms existing defenses. Our defense is the first that can withstand highly accurate model stealing attacks for tens of thousands of queries, amplifying the attacker's error rate up to a factor of 85$\\times$ with minimal impact on the utility for benign users.",

We formalize the recently proposed proof-of-authority consensus algorithms that are Byzantine fault tolerant by describing the Aura and Clique protocols present in the two mainstream implementations of Ethereum. We then introduce the Cloning Attack and show how to apply it to double spend in each of these protocols with a single malicious node. Our results show that the Cloning Attack against Aura is always successful while the same attack against Clique is about twice as fast and succeeds in most cases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Palaeovalleys are buried ancient river valleys that often form productive aquifers, especially in the semi-arid and arid areas of Australia. Delineating their extent and hydrostratigraphy is however a challenging task in groundwater system characterization. This study developed a methodology based on the deep learning super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) approach, to convert electrical conductivity (EC) estimates from an airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey in South Australia to a high-resolution binary palaeovalley map. The SRCNN was trained and tested with a synthetic training dataset, where valleys were generated from readily available digital elevation model (DEM) data from the AEM survey area. Electrical conductivities typical of valley sediments were generated by Archie\u2019s Law, and subsequently blurred by down-sampling and bicubic interpolation to represent noise from the AEM survey, inversion and interpolation. After a model training step, the SRCNN successfully removed such noise, and reclassified the low-resolution, unimodal but skewed EC values into a high-resolution palaeovalley index following a bimodal distribution. The latter allows distinguishing valley from non-valley pixels. Furthermore, a realistic spatial connectivity structure of the palaeovalley was predicted when compared with borehole lithology logs and valley bottom flatness indicator. Overall the methodology permitted to better constrain the three-dimensional palaeovalley geometry from AEM images that are becoming more widely available for groundwater prospecting.\n",

Explainable ML (i.e. explainable artificial intelligence or XAI) has been implemented in numerous open source and commercial packages and explainable ML is also an important, mandatory, or embedded aspect of commercial predictive modeling in industries like financial services. However, like many technologies, explainable ML can be misused, particularly as a faulty safeguard for harmful black-boxes, e.g. fairwashing or scaffolding, and for other malevolent purposes like stealing models and sensitive training data. To promote best-practice discussions for this already in-flight technology, this short text presents internal definitions and a few examples before covering the proposed guidelines. This text concludes with a seemingly natural argument for the use of interpretable models and explanatory, debugging, and disparate impact testing methods in life- or mission-critical ML systems.",

      "title": "Evasion Attacks Against Watermarking Techniques found in MLaaS Systems",
      "abstract": "Deep neural networks have had enormous impact on various domains of computer science applications, considerably outperforming previous state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. To achieve this performance, neural networks need large quantities of data and huge computational resources, which heavily increase their costs. The increased cost of building a good deep neural network model gives rise to a need for protecting this investment from potential copyright infringements. Legitimate owners of a machine learning model want to be able to reliably track and detect a malicious adversary that tries to steal the intellectual property related to the model. This threat is very relevant to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems, where a provider supplies APIs to clients, allowing them to interact with their trained proprietary deep learning models. Recently, this problem was tackled by introducing in deep neural networks the concept of watermarking, which allows a legitimate owner to embed some secret information (watermark) in a given model. Through the use of this watermark, the legitimate owners, remotely interacting with a model through input queries, are able to detect a copyright infringement, and prove the ownership of their models that were stolen/copied illegally. In this paper, we focus on assessing the robustness and reliability of state-of-the-art deep neural network watermarking schemes. In particular we show that, a malicious adversary, even in scenarios where the watermark is difficult to remove, can still evade the verification of copyright infringements from the legitimate owners, thus avoiding the detection of the model theft.",

      "abstract": "Along with the advent of deep neural networks came various methods of exploitation, such as fooling the classifier or contaminating its training data. Another such attack is known as model extraction, where provided API access to some black box neural network, the adversary extracts the underlying model. This is done by querying the model in such a way that the underlying neural network provides enough information to the adversary to be reconstructed. While several works have achieved impressive results with neural network extraction in the propositional domain, this problem has not yet been considered over the relational domain, where data samples are no longer considered to be independent and identically distributed (iid). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a popular deep learning framework to perform machine learning tasks over relational data. In this work, we formalize an instance of GNN extraction, present a solution with preliminary results, and discuss our assumptions and future directions.",

      "abstract": "As state-of-the-art deep neural networks are deployed at the core of more advanced Al-based products and services, the incentive for copying them (i.e., their intellectual properties) by rival adversaries is expected to increase considerably over time. The best way to extract or steal knowledge from such networks is by querying them using a large dataset of random samples and recording their output, followed by training a student network to mimic these outputs, without making any assumption about the original networks. The most effective way to protect against such a mimicking attack is to provide only the classification result, without confidence values associated with the softmax layer.In this paper, we present a novel method for generating composite images for attacking a mentor neural network using a student model. Our method assumes no information regarding the mentor's training dataset, architecture, or weights. Further assuming no information regarding the mentor's softmax output values, our method successfully mimics the given neural network and steals all of its knowledge. We also demonstrate that our student network (which copies the mentor) is impervious to watermarking protection methods, and thus would not be detected as a stolen model.Our results imply, essentially, that all current neural networks are vulnerable to mimicking attacks, even if they do not divulge anything but the most basic required output, and that the student model which mimics them cannot be easily detected and singled out as a stolen copy using currently available techniques.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has gained tremendous success and great popularity in the past few years. However, recent research found that it is suffering several inherent weaknesses, which can threaten the security and privacy of the stackholders. Deep learning's wide use further magnifies the caused consequences. To this end, lots of research has been conducted with the purpose of exhaustively identifying intrinsic weaknesses and subsequently proposing feasible mitigation. Yet few is clear about how these weaknesses are incurred and how effective are these attack approaches in assaulting deep learning. In order to unveil the security weaknesses and aid in the development of a robust deep learning system, we are devoted to undertaking a comprehensive investigation on attacks towards deep learning, and extensively evaluating these attacks in multiple views. In particular, we focus on four types of attacks associated with security and privacy of deep learning: model extraction attack, model inversion attack, poisoning attack and adversarial attack. For each type of attack, we construct its essential workflow as well as adversary capabilities and attack goals. Many pivot metrics are devised for evaluating the attack approaches, by which we perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis. From the analysis, we have identified significant and indispensable factors in an attack vector, \\eg, how to reduce queries to target models, what distance used for measuring perturbation. We spot light on 17 findings covering these approaches' merits and demerits, success probability, deployment complexity and prospects. Moreover, we discuss other potential security weaknesses and possible mitigation which can inspire relevant researchers in this area.",

      "abstract": "The advancement in deep learning has taken the technology world by storm in the last decade. Although, there is enormous progress made in terms of algorithm performance, the security aspect of these algorithms has not received a lot of attention from the research community. As more industries start to adopt these algorithms the issue of security is becoming even more relevant. Security vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML), especially in deep neural networks (DNN), is becoming a concern. Various techniques have been proposed, including data manipulations and model stealing. However, most of them are focused on ML algorithms and target threat models that require access to training dataset. In this paper, we present a methodology that analyzes the DNN weight parameters under the threat model that assumes the attacker has the access to the weight memory only. This analysis is then used to develop an attack that manipulates weight parameters with respect to their sensitivity. To evaluate this attack, we implemented our methodology on a MLP trained on IRIS dataset and LeNet (DNN architecture) trained on MNIST dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that alteration of model parameters results in subtle accuracy drop of the model. Depending on the applications such subtle changes can cause significant system malfunction or disruption, for example in vision-based industrial applications. Our results show that using our methodology a subtle accuracy drop can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time with very few parameter changes.",

In this work, we ask to what extent can an adversary steal functionality of such ``victim'' models based solely on blackbox interactions: image in, predictions out. In contrast to prior work, we study complex victim blackbox models, and an adversary lacking knowledge of train/test data used by the model, its internals, and semantics over model outputs. We formulate model functionality stealing as a two-step approach: (i) querying a set of input images to the blackbox model to obtain predictions; and (ii) training a ``knockoff'' with queried image-prediction pairs. We make multiple remarkable observations: (a) querying random images from a different distribution than that of the blackbox training data results in a well-performing knockoff; (b) this is possible even when the knockoff is represented using a different architecture; and (c) our reinforcement learning approach additionally improves query sample efficiency in certain settings and provides performance gains. We validate model functionality stealing on a range of datasets and tasks, as well as show that a reasonable knockoff of an image analysis API could be created for as little as $30.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning is gaining importance in many applications. However, Neural Networks face several security and privacy threats. This is particularly significant in the scenario where Cloud infrastructures deploy a service with Neural Network model at the back end. Here, an adversary can extract the Neural Network parameters, infer the regularization hyperparameter, identify if a data point was part of the training data, and generate effective transferable adversarial examples to evade classifiers. This paper shows how a Neural Network model is susceptible to timing side channel attack. In this paper, a black box Neural Network extraction attack is proposed by exploiting the timing side channels to infer the depth of the network. Although, constructing an equivalent architecture is a complex search problem, it is shown how Reinforcement Learning with knowledge distillation can effectively reduce the search space to infer a target model. The proposed approach has been tested with VGG architectures on CIFAR10 data set. It is observed that it is possible to reconstruct substitute models with test accuracy close to the target models and the proposed approach is scalable and independent of type of Neural Network architectures.",

We present two novel strategies that measure either the information gain or the coverage of the feature space spanned by user queries to estimate the learning rate of individual and colluding adversaries.

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models may be deemed confidential due to their sensitive training data, commercial value, or use in security applications. Increasingly often, confidential ML models are being deployed with publicly accessible query interfaces. ML-as-a-service (\"predictive analytics\") systems are an example: Some allow users to train models on potentially sensitive data and charge others for access on a pay-per-query basis. \nThe tension between model confidentiality and public access motivates our investigation of model extraction attacks. In such attacks, an adversary with black-box access, but no prior knowledge of an ML model's parameters or training data, aims to duplicate the functionality of (i.e., \"steal\") the model. Unlike in classical learning theory settings, ML-as-a-service offerings may accept partial feature vectors as inputs and include confidence values with predictions. Given these practices, we show simple, efficient attacks that extract target ML models with near-perfect fidelity for popular model classes including logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees. We demonstrate these attacks against the online services of BigML and Amazon Machine Learning. We further show that the natural countermeasure of omitting confidence values from model outputs still admits potentially harmful model extraction attacks. Our results highlight the need for careful ML model deployment and new model extraction countermeasures.",
