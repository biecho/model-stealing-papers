      "title": "Improved Attack Classification and Reduced Misclassification in Cloud Security with Multi-Class AdaBoost Models",
      "abstract": "Objectives: A robust capability of detecting intrusions is crucial in the monitoring and detection process of cloud security endeavors against cyber-attack. With the emergence of cloud networks, new software vulnerabilities are brought into being which create openings for cybercriminals. Adapting AdaBoost with weak classifier algorithms achieves significant enhancement of the detection rate in cloud environments. The investigation uses the precision, recall, and, respectively, F1-score to measure AdaBoost\u2019s efficiency to determine whether the model can be relied upon and is accurate for intrusion detection. Methods: AdaBoost was used to examine AWS cloud network data and identify several features of network attack. To test the model, precision, recall, f1 score and 5-fold cross validation were applied showing the stability and the accuracy of the results. Findings: AdaBoost achieved 96% overall accuracy. All identified network threats, except class 3 attacks were detected correctly with the recall being unacceptably low at 0% for class 3 attacks due to model limitations. For each of the 5 iterations of the cross-validation, the model showed perfect accuracy, that was 100% precision, recall, and F1-score for most categories. As opposed to earlier work, which had 93.4% 1 and 88% 2, this model was more accurate. Novelty: Making use of scrutinizing misclassifications, this paper exposes the elements of the model that require review and elevates a superior analysis after an attack. The real AWS data analysis improves the proposed approach leading to better security insights and more accurate cloud defense systems.\n\nKeywords: Cloud Security, Forensic Analysis, AdaBoost, Attack Detection, Intrusion Detection",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) will play an important role in realizing maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs). However, as a double-edged sword, this new technology brings forth new threats. The purpose of this study is to raise awareness among stakeholders regarding the potential security threats posed by AI in MASSs. To achieve this, we propose a hypothetical attack scenario in which a clean-label poisoning attack was executed on an object detection model, which resulted in boats being misclassified as ferries, thus preventing the detection of pirates approaching a boat. We used the poison frog algorithm to generate poisoning instances, and trained a YOLOv5 model with both clean and poisoned data. Despite the high accuracy of the model, it misclassified boats as ferries owing to the poisoning of the target instance. Although the experiment was conducted under limited conditions, we confirmed vulnerabilities in the object detection algorithm. This misclassification could lead to inaccurate AI decision making and accidents. The hypothetical scenario proposed in this study emphasizes the vulnerability of object detection models to clean-label poisoning attacks, and the need for mitigation strategies against security threats posed by AI in the maritime industry.",

      "abstract": "As smart grid enables two-way flow of data and electricity with Advanced Metering Infrastructure, it is prone to security vulnerabilities. Sybil attack, one such vulnerability exhibits multiple identities of same node. As a consequence, the compromised or malicious nodes present in smart grid inject false information that would cause a serious impact in a critical infrastructure i.e. smart grid. Hence, the proposal aims to detect this attack based on node's Received Signal Strength, address, energy consumption and distance using machine learning algorithm. Support vector machine outperforms other machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighborhood, Naive Baye's, and K-Nearest Neighborhood in terms of accuracy, training time, misclassification cost, prediction speed, sensitivity or recall, specificity, F1 score, precision, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC). Further, the performance of the model is optimized using hyper parameter tuning. The proposal is implemented in MATLAB.

      "abstract": "Due to the rising awareness of privacy and security in machine learning applications, federated learning (FL) has received widespread attention and applied to several areas, e.g., intelligence healthcare systems, IoT-based industries, and smart cities. FL enables clients to train a global model collaboratively without accessing their local training data. However, the current FL schemes are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Its architecture makes detecting and defending against malicious model updates difficult. In addition, most recent studies to detect FL from malicious updates while maintaining the model's privacy have not been sufficiently explored. This article proposed blockchain-based federated learning with SMPC model verification against poisoning attacks for healthcare systems. First, we check the machine learning model from the FL participants through an encrypted inference process and remove the compromised model. Once the participants\u2019 local models have been verified, the models are sent to the blockchain node to be securely aggregated. We conducted several experiments with different medical datasets to evaluate our proposed framework.",

      "title": "On the Robustness of Variational Quantum Classifier Against \u201cLabel Flipping Attacks\u201d in Federated Learning for Semiconductor Manufacturing",
      "abstract": "Due to the widespread presence of manufacturing units, real-time data collection becomes a challenging task, especially as the scale of operations continues to expand. Moreover, manufacturing industries often deal with sensitive and proprietary data and are reluctant to share data directly in areas like lithography hotspot detection (LHD) due to concerns about IP protection and regulatory compliance. Moreover, human error can lead to incorrect labeling of parts or products. Detecting hotspots in lithography is crucial for ensuring the product quality and reliability of the manufacturing process. In today's context, Federated Learning (FL) stands out as a crucial remedy, facilitating the rapid advancement of distributed machine learning while effectively managing critical concerns regarding data privacy and governance. Moreover, FL systems must be robust against not only malicious label flipping attacks but also inadvertent human errors. In recent years, the convergence of quantum computing and machine learning represents a groundbreaking interdisciplinary approach with immense potential for revolutionizing various industries ranging from healthcare to manufacturing. In this work, we proposed a Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) framework for lithography hotspot detection and offer a unique solution to address the challenges mentioned above effectively. To demonstrate the generalization ability and robustness, we performed extensive experiments with label-flipping attacks in the proposed framework. Based on our results, the global quantum model maintained a high classification accuracy and best performance even when faced with label-flipping attacks from a specific number of clients in federated learning settings, while keeping data private across manufacturing units. Moreover, a defense strategy based on clustering is proposed to distinguish the good and bad model updates from the participants in a quantum federated framework.",

      "abstract": "In the semiconductor landscape, safeguarding integrated circuits against Hardware Trojans (HT) is critical.To address this pressing concern, supervised machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising defense mechanism for HT detection. However, the vulnerability of supervised ML-based defense mechanisms to adversarial attacks poses a substantial challenge, potentially compromising model prediction performance. This paper presents a label flipping poisoning attack, strategically targeting supervised ML-based HT detection systems during the pre-silicon IC design phase. Leveraging the power of the Isolation Forest, our method first identifies potential Trojan nets through a process of random partitioning, flips their labels, and perturbs the model training process. Further, random subsampling is applied to select a subset of Trojan-free samples, whose labels are also flipped. This model-independent, untargeted, and black-box attack is evaluated against Trust-Hub & DeTrust Benchmarks, resulting in a substantial reduction in model recall, challenging the reliability of ML-based HT detection systems.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of Hardware Trojans (HT) has raised significant concerns in the semiconductor industry due to their stealthy nature. Machine learning (ML) models have gained attention as a promising solution for HT detection. However, the increasing reliance on ML makes these detection systems prone to adversarial attacks, which degrade the prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel Label Flipping Dataset Poisoning Attack designed to target the ML-based HT detection system during the pre-silicon IC design phase. The proposed attack flips the small portion of labels of the training dataset to malign the ML model training, which eventually provides wrong predictions from unseen IC gate-level netlists. A local outlier factor model is employed, which identifies the Trojan samples from the training dataset and random sample search is performed to find the Trojan-free samples. Further, the set of samples which provides maximum performance degradation after flipping labels is selected. The proposed attack is an untargeted, model-independent, and black box attack. The proposed attack on Trust-Hub & DeTrust Benchmarks results in an average 75.70% and 80.38% decrease in model accuracy on unseen datasets, undermining the reliability of ML-based HT detection systems.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the furious competitiveness in global markets and speedy improvements in information technology lead to shorter product life cycles, lesser transportation capabilities, and increased demands as well. In most business scenarios, the supply chain network is becoming one of the most vital focusing areas. In the supply chain network, blockchain technology is a promising solution for secure information sharing. However, it is a bit critical in maintaining security at each level of the blockchain and hence the public\u2013private\u2013key cryptography is more commonly preferred. This study intends to construct a new privacy preservation model in the field of supply chain networks based on blockchain technology by undergoing three major phases, namely, (a) data sanitization, (b) key generation, and (c) restoration. Further, the sensitive fields in the original data are selected during the data sanitization phase, and in the key generation phase; the optimal key is generated to hide the selected sensitive fields. The hidden data with the secured key is transferred from the source (manufacturer) to destination (vendor) in the supply chain network via the blockchain. The restoration process takes place in the receiver side with the help of the same key. Among all these data flow methods, the optimal key selection is the critical issue that needs to be overridden to make the data transmission secured. As a novelty, a new optimization algorithm referred to as Whale with New Crosspoint\u2010based Update (WNU), which is the advanced version of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), is developed here to select the optimal key. Finally, the proposed WNU model is analyzed in terms of Hiding Failure (HF) rate, Information Preservation (IP) Rate, and False Rule generation (FR), and Degree of Modification (DM). The proposed secured information sharing in supply chain management (SCM) with blockchain technology will be validated by comparing it over the traditional models in terms of security as well.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the problems of data sanitization and cyber situational awareness by analyzing 910 GB of real Internet-scale traffic, which has been passively collected by monitoring close to 16.5 million darknet IP addresses from a /8 and a /13 network telescopes. First, the paper offers a novel probabilistic darknet preprocessing model, which aims at sanitizing darknet data to prepare it for effective use in the task of cyber threat intelligence generation. Such model has been engineered using a distributed multithreaded approach, rendering it operational and highly effective on darknet big data. Second, the paper further contributes by presenting an innovative approach to infer large-scale orchestrated probing campaigns by leveraging darknet data, for Internet cyber situational awareness. The approach uniquely reduces the dimensionality of such big data by utilizing its artifacts, instead of processing the actual raw data. This is accomplished by extracting and analyzing probing time series using formal methods rooted in Fourier transform and Kalman filtering. Thorough empirical evaluations indeed validate the accuracy and the performance of the proposed methods and techniques. We assert that the darknet sanitization model and the probing orchestration inference approach are of significant value, given their postulated highly applicable nature to the field of Internet measurements for cyber security in the era of big data.",

      "abstract": "The adversarial model presented by trusted execution environments (TEEs) has prompted researchers to investigate unusual attack vectors. One particularly powerful class of controlled-channel attacks abuses page-table modifications to reliably track enclave memory accesses at a page-level granularity. In contrast to noisy microarchitectural timing leakage, this line of deterministic controlled-channel attacks abuses indispensable architectural interfaces and hence cannot be mitigated by tweaking microarchitectural resources. \nWe propose an innovative controlled-channel attack, named CopyCat, that deterministically counts the number of instructions executed within a single enclave code page. We show that combining the instruction counts harvested by CopyCat with traditional, coarse-grained page-level leakage allows the accurate reconstruction of enclave control flow at a maximal instruction-level granularity. CopyCat can identify intra-page and intra-cache line branch decisions that ultimately may only differ in a single instruction, underscoring that even extremely subtle control flow deviations can be deterministically leaked from secure enclaves. We demonstrate the improved resolution and practicality of CopyCat on Intel SGX in an extensive study of single-trace and deterministic attacks against cryptographic implementations, and give novel algorithmic attacks to perform single-trace key extraction that exploit subtle vulnerabilities in the latest versions of widely-used cryptographic libraries. Our findings highlight the importance of stricter verification of cryptographic implementations, especially in the context of TEEs.",

      "title": "PLeak: Prompt Leaking Attacks against Large Language Model Applications",
      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new ecosystem with many downstream applications, called LLM applications, with different natural language processing tasks. The functionality and performance of an LLM application highly depend on its system prompt, which instructs the backend LLM on what task to perform. Therefore, an LLM application developer often keeps a system prompt confidential to protect its intellectual property. As a result, a natural attack, called prompt leaking, is to steal the system prompt from an LLM application, which compromises the developer's intellectual property. Existing prompt leaking attacks primarily rely on manually crafted queries, and thus achieve limited effectiveness. In this paper, we design a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. We formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. Our key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt. We evaluate PLeak in both offline settings and for real-world LLM applications, e.g., those on Poe, a popular platform hosting such applications. Our results show that PLeak can effectively leak system prompts and significantly outperforms not only baselines that manually curate queries but also baselines with optimized queries that are modified and adapted from existing jailbreaking attacks. We responsibly reported the issues to Poe and are still waiting for their response. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/BHui97/PLeak.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of network technology, information spreads rapidly through the network. High-speed wide area network and broadband metropolitan area network have been widely used in enterprise communications, promoting the improvement of enterprise information level in modern society, and enhancing the market competitiveness of enterprises. However, it is worth noting that while Internet technology and the Internet are widely used, the activities of viruses and hackers are increasingly rampant, and various new network attacks and viruses emerge in an endless stream, bringing unprecedented security risks to network security. The target of attackers is to penetrate the network and steal valuable data. The goal of the defender is to prevent attackers from intruding into the network. Attacks can be divided into two types: reconnaissance and violent attack. Reconnaissance is when an attacker tries to find information about the target, while a violent attack attempts all possible passwords or key combinations until a valid password or password is found. Violent attacks are more likely to succeed against poorly protected systems because they do not require time to test each password or key combination. In order to evaluate the network information system security and active defense, the network defense graph model, the classification of attack and defense strategies and the cost quantification method, the network attack and defense game model and the optimal active defense selection algorithm based on the above models are proposed. Finally, a typical network example is used to analyze the application of the above models and algorithms in network security evaluation and optimal active defense. The analysis results show that the proposed models and methods are feasible and effective.",

      "abstract": "Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) threaten modern machine learning systems by enabling adversaries to steal models, exposing intellectual property and training data. With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in distributed computing environments, including cloud, edge, and federated learning settings, each paradigm introduces distinct vulnerabilities and challenges. Without a unified perspective on MEAs across these distributed environments, organizations risk fragmented defenses, inadequate risk assessments, and substantial economic and privacy losses. This survey is motivated by the urgent need to understand how the unique characteristics of cloud, edge, and federated deployments shape attack vectors and defense requirements. We systematically examine the evolution of attack methodologies and defense mechanisms across these environments, demonstrating how environmental factors influence security strategies in critical sectors such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and financial services. By synthesizing recent advances in MEAs research and discussing the limitations of current evaluation practices, this survey provides essential insights for developing robust and adaptive defense strategies. Our comprehensive approach highlights the importance of integrating protective measures across the entire distributed computing landscape to ensure the secure deployment of machine learning models.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms provides the industrial domain with many critical solutions, such as joint venture virtual production systems. However, the extensive interconnection of industrial systems with corporate systems in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks exposes the industrial domain to severe cyber risks. Because of many proprietary multilevel protocols, limited upgrade opportunities, heterogeneous communication infrastructures, and a very large trust boundary, conventional IT security fails to prevent cyberattacks against IIoT networks. Recent secure protocols, such as secure distributed network protocol (DNP 3.0), are limited to weak hash functions for critical response time requirements. As a complementary, we propose an adaptive trust boundary protection for IIoT networks using a deep-learning, feature-extraction-based semisupervised model. Our proposed approach is novel in that it is compatible with multilevel protocols of IIoT. The proposed approach does not require any manual effort to update the attack databases and can learn the rapidly changing natures of unknown attack models using unsupervised learnings and unlabeled data from the wild. Therefore, the proposed approach is resilient to emerging cyberattacks and their dynamic nature. The proposed approach has been verified using a real IIoT testbed. Extensive experimental analysis of the attack models and results shows that the proposed approach significantly improves the identification of attacks over conventional security control techniques.",

      "abstract": "\"Does generative AI infringe copyright?\" is an urgent question. It is also a difficult question, for two reasons. First, \"generative AI\" is not just one product from one company. It is a catch-all name for a massive ecosystem of loosely related technologies. These systems behave differently and raise different legal issues. Second, copyright law is notoriously complicated, and generative-AI systems manage to touch on a great many corners of it. They raise issues of authorship, similarity, direct and indirect liability, and fair use, among much else. These issues cannot be analyzed in isolation, because there are connections everywhere. We aim to bring order to the chaos. To do so, we introduce the generative-AI supply chain: an interconnected set of stages that transform training data into generations. The supply chain reveals all of the places at which companies and users make choices that have copyright consequences. It enables us to trace the effects of upstream technical designs on downstream uses, and to assess who in these complicated sociotechnical systems bears responsibility for infringement when it happens. Because we engage so closely with the technology of generative AI, we are able to shed more light on the copyright questions. We identify the key decisions that courts will need to make as they grapple with these issues, and point out the consequences that would likely flow from different liability regimes. This article is a much-abbreviated version of a forthcoming law review article at The Journal of the Copyright Society.",

      "abstract": "As the AI supply chain grows more complex, AI systems and models are increasingly likely to incorporate multiple internally- or externally-sourced components such as datasets and (pre-trained) models. In such cases, determining whether or not the aggregate AI system or model complies with the EU AI Act (AIA) requires a multi-step process in which compliance-related information about both the AI system or model and all its component parts is: (1) gathered, potentially from multiple arms-length sources; (2) harmonized, if necessary; (3) inputted into an analysis that looks across all of it to render a compliance prediction. Because this process is so complex and time-consuming, it threatens to overburden the limited compliance resources of the AI providers (i.e., developers) who bear much of the responsibility for complying with the AIA. It also renders rapid or real-time compliance analyses infeasible in many AI development scenarios where they would be beneficial to providers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a complete system for automating provider-side AIA compliance analyses amidst a complex AI supply chain. This system has two key elements. First is an interlocking set of computational, multi-stakeholder transparency artifacts that capture AIA-specific metadata about both: (1) the provider's overall AI system or model; and (2) the datasets and pre-trained models it incorporates as components. Second is an algorithm that operates across all those artifacts to render a real-time prediction about whether or not the aggregate AI system or model complies with the AIA. All told, this system promises to dramatically facilitate and democratize provider-side AIA compliance analyses (and, perhaps by extension, provider-side AIA compliance).",

      "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into supply chain systems promises to revolutionize logistics, inventory management, demand forecasting, and real-time decision-making. However, the successful deployment of AI technologies is heavily dependent on robust infrastructure and a conducive regulatory environment. This explores the contrasting infrastructure and regulatory barriers to AI-driven supply chain systems in Nigeria and the United States, representing a developing and a developed economy, respectively. In Nigeria, major infrastructure challenges include inadequate broadband connectivity, unreliable power supply, limited data center availability, and poorly maintained transport and logistics networks. These issues hinder the real-time data collection and processing required for effective AI deployment. Furthermore, the digitalization of supply chains remains minimal, and access to structured datasets is limited. On the regulatory front, Nigeria faces a lack of clear AI governance frameworks, weak data protection laws, inconsistent customs processes, and an underdeveloped standardization ecosystem. In contrast, the United States benefits from advanced digital infrastructure, including widespread 5G coverage, high-capacity data centers, and integrated transport systems equipped with IoT technologies. Regulatory frameworks in the U.S. are more developed, with emerging AI-specific guidelines, data privacy laws such as the CCPA and HIPAA, and standardized compliance mechanisms. However, even in the U.S., challenges persist in harmonizing AI regulations across states and balancing innovation with ethical concerns. The disparity between Nigeria and the U.S. highlights the need for tailored strategies to overcome barriers. While the U.S. continues to refine its regulatory oversight and invest in AI innovation, Nigeria must prioritize foundational infrastructure development, policy reforms, and capacity building to enable AI integration. Understanding these comparative barriers is essential for policymakers, investors, and supply chain stakeholders aiming to harness AI\u2019s full potential in both contexts. \nKeywords: Infrastructure, Regulatory Barriers, AI, Supply Chain Systems, Nigeria, U.S.",

      "abstract": "DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejece.2020.4.6.252 Vol 4 | Issue 6 | November 2020 1 Abstract \u2014 Artificial intelligence (AI) was introduced to develop and create \u201cthinking machines\u201d that are capable of mimicking, learning, and replacing human intelligence. Since the late 1970s, AI has shown great promise in improving human decision-making processes and the subsequent productivity in various business endeavors due to its ability to recognize business patterns, learn business phenomena, seek information, and analyze data intelligently. Despite its widespread acceptance as a decision-aid tool, AI has seen limited application in supply chain management (SCM). To fully exploit the potential benefits of AI for SCM, this paper explores various sub-fields of AI that are most suitable for solving practical problems relevant to SCM. In so doing, this paper reviews the past record of success in AI applications to SCM and identifies the most fruitful areas of SCM in which to apply AI.",

While artificial intelligence (AI) strengthens resilience, research is needed to understand how cloud adoption can foster integration, collaboration, adaptation and sustainable manufacturing. Therefore, this study aimed to unleash the power of cloud adoption and AI in optimizing resilience and sustainable performance through collaboration and adaptive capabilities at manufacturing firms.Design/methodology/approachThis research followed a deductive approach and employed a quantitative method with a survey technique to collect data from its target population. The study used stratified random sampling with a sample size of 1,279 participants working in diverse manufacturing industries across California, Texas and New York.FindingsThis research investigated how companies can make their manufacturing supply chains more resilient and sustainable. The findings revealed that integrating the manufacturing supply chains can foster collaboration and enhance adaptability, leading to better performance (hypotheses H1-H7, except H5). Additionally, utilizing artificial intelligence helps improve adaptability, further strengthening resilience and sustainability (H8-H11). Interestingly, the study found that internal integration alone does not significantly impact collaboration (H5). This suggests that external factors are more critical in fostering collaboration within the manufacturing supply chain during disruptions.Originality/valueThis study dives into the complex world of interconnected factors (formative constructs in higher order) influencing manufacturing supply chains. Using advanced modeling techniques, it highlights the powerful impact of cloud-based integration. Cloud-based integration and artificial intelligence unlock significant improvements for manufacturers and decision-makers by enabling information processes and dynamic capability theory.",

      "abstract": "PurposeDrawing upon socio-technical system theory, this study intends to investigate the effects of the congruence and incongruence between artificial intelligence (AI) and explorative learning on supply chain resilience as well as the moderating role of organizational inertia.Design/methodology/approachUsing survey data collected from 170 Chinese manufacturing firms, we performed polynomial regression and response surface analyses to test our hypotheses.FindingsWe find that the congruence between AI and explorative learning enhances firms\u2019 supply chain resilience, while the incongruence between these two factors impairs their supply chain resilience. In addition, compared with low\u2013low congruence, high\u2013high congruence between AI and explorative learning improves supply chain resilience to a greater extent. Moreover, organizational inertia attenuates the positive influence of the congruence between AI and explorative learning on supply chain resilience, while it aggravates the negative influence of the incongruence between these two factors on supply chain resilience.Originality/valueOur study expands the literature on supply chain resilience by demonstrating that the congruence between a firm\u2019s AI (i.e. technical aspect) and explorative learning (i.e. social aspect) boosts its supply chain resilience. More importantly, our study sheds new light on the role of organizational inertia in moderating the congruent effect of AI and explorative learning, thereby extending the boundary condition for socio-technical system theory in the supply chain resilience literature.",

This paper on AI-powered predictive analytics will address improving the competitiveness and effectiveness of supply chain operations. Nevertheless, current methods are not always scalable or adaptable to complex supply networks and changing market environments. Therefore, this paper posits that Supply Chain Optimization using Artificial Intelligence (SCO-AI) systems can help with these concerns. SCO-AI employs real-time data analysis and advanced machine learning algorithms which results to reduced response time, enhanced logistics route optimization, improved demand planning as well as real-time inventory control. Thus, the idea herein suggested fits smoothly into existing supply chain frameworks for data-driven decisions that make companies remain agile in ever-changing market dynamics. SCO-AI implementation has seen significant improvements in inventory turnover rate, rates of on-time delivery as well as overall supply chain costs. In this period of high business turbulence, such kind of research builds up the robustness of a given supply chain while at the same time minimizing operational risks by means of simulations and case studies",

      "abstract": "Impact sourcing is the practice of employing socio-economically disadvantaged individuals at business process outsourcing centres to reduce poverty and create secure jobs. One of the pioneers of impact sourcing is Sama, a training-data company that focuses on annotating data for artificial intelligence (AI) systems and claims to support an ethical AI supply chain through its business operations. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken at three of Sama\u2019s East African delivery centres in Kenya and Uganda and follow-up online interviews, this article interrogates Sama\u2019s claims regarding the benefits of its impact sourcing model. Our analysis reveals alarming accounts of low wages, insecure work, a tightly disciplined labour management process, gender-based exploitation and harassment and a system designed to extract value from low-paid workers to produce profits for investors. We argue that competitive market-based dynamics generate a powerful force that pushes such companies towards limiting the actual social impact of their business model in favour of ensuring higher profit margins. This force can be resisted, but only through countervailing measures such as pressure from organised workers, civil society, or regulation. These findings have broad implications related to working conditions for low-wage data annotators across the sector and cast doubt on the ethical nature of AI products that rely on this form of AI data work.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial Intelligence (AI) is woven into a supply chain of capital, commodities and human labour that has been neglected in critical debates. Given the current surge in generative AI \u2013 which is estimated to drive up the extraction of natural resources such as minerals, fossil fuels or water \u2013 it is vital to investigate its entire production line from a critical infrastructural perspective. Drawing on the supply chain capitalism, a concept coined by Anna L. Tsing in 2009, this paper contributes to critical AI studies by investigating the structure of AI supply chains, taking into account the mining, electronics, digital and e-waste industry. This paper illustrates how the supply chain capitalism of AI is precipitating geographical asymmetries connected to contested struggles in M\u00e9xico by focusing on a key element of these chains: data centres. In times of climate emergency, this paper calls to reconsider algorithmic harms and resistance by investigating the entire capitalist production line of the AI industry from critical and environmental lens.",

      "abstract": "Poor visibility of extreme weather (EW)-induced risks and their relationships in the cocoa supply chain induces inefficient risk management and is detrimental to the resilience of the supply chain. On the basis of the resource-based view, emerging technologies can form critical organizational resources to manage these EW-induced risks effectively. Therefore, this article focuses on EW-induced supply chain risks and how artificial intelligence (AI) helps to mitigate them. First, a cognitive mapping approach is used to identify EW-induced risks, their direct links, EW occurrences, and AI capabilities that might mitigate their negative impacts. Second, the best-worst method (BWM) is adopted to rank these EW-induced risks. BWM results suggest that EW-induced risks are prominent in the midstream supply chain, followed by upstream and downstream. EW-induced transportation, farm, and demand risks are the most prevalent of the 11 risk factors, while psychological stress, market share risk, and customer dissatisfaction are the least prominent. This finding reveals that although the EW-induced risks have the greatest impact on local firms, they will be transferred to upstream and downstream firms. Furthermore, a data requirement-based evaluation of AI algorithms and a conceptual framework are developed for a systematic approach to selecting and designing an AI system for managing EW-induced supply chain risks. This study empirically discloses the multilevel relationships between AI capabilities and EW-induced supply chain risks, which can help supply chain professionals effectively manage EW-induced risks through AI.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly, and nowadays, it is exploited by cyber attacks on IoT devices. An accurate system to identify malicious attacks on the IoT environment has become very important for minimizing security risks on IoT devices. Botnet attacks are among the most serious and widespread attacks, and they threaten IoT devices. Motionless IoT devices have a security weakness due to lack of sufficient memory and computation results for a security platform. In addition, numerous existing systems present themselves for finding unknown patterns from IoT networks to improve security. In this study, hybrid deep learning, a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm, was proposed to detect botnet attacks, namely, BASHLITE and Mirai, on nine commercial IoT devices. Extensive empirical research was performed by employing a real N-BaIoT dataset extracted from a real system, including benign and malicious patterns. The experimental results exposed the superiority of the CNN-LSTM model with accuracies of 90.88% and 88.61% in detecting botnet attacks from doorbells (Danminin and Ennio brands), whereas the proposed system achieved good accuracy (88.53%) in identifying botnet attacks from thermostat devices. The accuracies of the proposed system in detecting botnet attacks from security cameras were 87.19%, 89.23%, 87.76%, and 89.64%, with respect to accuracy metrics. Overall, the CNN-LSTM model was successful in detecting botnet attacks from various IoT devices with optimal accuracy.",

      "title": "An Evolutionary SVM Model for DDOS Attack Detection in Software Defined Networks",
      "abstract": "Software-Defined Network (SDN) has become a promising network architecture in current days that provide network operators more control over the network infrastructure. The controller, also called as the operating system of the SDN, is responsible for running various network applications and maintaining several network services and functionalities. Despite all its capabilities, the introduction of various architectural entities of SDN poses many security threats and potential targets. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a rapidly growing attack that poses a tremendous threat to the Internet. As the control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attacks, the goal of this paper is to detect the attack traffic, by taking the centralized control aspect of SDN. Nowadays, in the field of SDN, various machine learning (ML) techniques are being deployed for detecting malicious traffic. Despite these works, choosing the relevant features and accurate classifiers for attack detection is an open question. For better detection accuracy, in this work, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is assisted by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) with genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed SVM model, KPCA is used for reducing the dimension of feature vectors, and GA is used for optimizing different SVM parameters. In order to reduce the noise caused by feature differences, an improved kernel function (N-RBF) is proposed. The experimental results show that compared to single-SVM, the proposed model achieves more accurate classification with better generalization. Moreover, the proposed model can be embedded within the controller to define security rules to prevent possible attacks by the attackers.",

      "title": "From Attack Trees to Attack-Defense Trees with Generative AI & Natural Language Processing",
      "abstract": "Attack-defense trees, an extension of attack trees, are extensively used by security engineers to document potential countermeasures for security threats present in a system's design. These trees help integrate initial system models with countermeasures, allowing for early testing of their efficiency and impact in the design cycle. Despite advancements in automating attack tree construction, selecting the initial set of countermeasures for conversion into an attack-defense tree remains largely manual. This paper proposes an approach and a tool that extends the TTool-AI attack tree generation feature by leveraging large language models and natural language processing to create a set of countermeasures and generate attack-defense trees based on an input attack tree. To evaluate our contribution, our approach is tested using attack-defense trees generated from attack trees, each representing possible threats to an associated system specification. In addition, we introduce metrics to assess the semantic correctness and completeness of the generated attack-defense trees. We compared, using our metrics, the attack-defense trees created from our methodology to those created by an engineer and found that attack-defense trees created using AI and secondary mitigation data provided better trees than solely using AI. We also discovered that this approach generated trees that were comparable to the quality of attack-defense trees generated from a security engineer at the associate level. From these results, we believe that our contribution could aid engineers in identifying not only appropriate countermeasures for attack trees but also the optimal number of countermeasures, avoiding the complexity of redundant mitigations. Furthermore, our approach complements standard modeling practices, particularly during the initial design phase, reducing the need for time-consuming re-engineering throughout the system's lifecycle.",

      "abstract": "\n A system-in-package (SiP) design takes advantage of cutting-edge packaging technology and heterogeneous integration (HI) in response to the growing need for aggressive time-to-market, high-performance, less expensive, and smaller systems. However, aggregating dies with different functionalities introduces new attack vectors with fault-injection attacks (FIA) that can effectively alter a circuit's data and control flow maliciously to cause disruptions of secure communication or sensitive information leakage. Additionally, traditional threat models associated with FIA on a 2D monolithic system-on-chip (SoC), and the corresponding mitigation techniques may not be compatible with modern 2.5D and 3D SiP architectures. To address these limitations, we propose system-aware fault injection attack detection for SiP architectures (SYSFID), a real-time and on-chip sensor-based fault monitoring approach integrated into a system-level design. SYSFID detects any fault-induced anomalous alterations in path delays of the components of inter-chiplet networks by strategically placing on-chip fault-to-time converter (FTC) sensors and controlling them efficiently to safeguard overall system security. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SYSFID, we detect several fault injection attempts on the FPGA implementation of a network-on-chip (NoC) based architecture during secure network packet transfers. Our experiments also illustrate that the SYSFID framework reliably senses both global and local FIAs with minimal overheads.",

      "abstract": "The reliance of popular programming languages such as Python and JavaScript on centralized package repositories and open-source software, combined with the emergence of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs), has created a new type of threat to the software supply chain: package hallucinations. These hallucinations, which arise from fact-conflicting errors when generating code using LLMs, represent a novel form of package confusion attack that poses a critical threat to the integrity of the software supply chain. This paper conducts a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of package hallucinations across different programming languages, settings, and parameters, exploring how a diverse set of models and configurations affect the likelihood of generating erroneous package recommendations and identifying the root causes of this phenomenon. Using 16 popular LLMs for code generation and two unique prompt datasets, we generate 576,000 code samples in two programming languages that we analyze for package hallucinations. Our findings reveal that that the average percentage of hallucinated packages is at least 5.2% for commercial models and 21.7% for open-source models, including a staggering 205,474 unique examples of hallucinated package names, further underscoring the severity and pervasiveness of this threat. To overcome this problem, we implement several hallucination mitigation strategies and show that they are able to significantly reduce the number of package hallucinations while maintaining code quality. Our experiments and findings highlight package hallucinations as a persistent and systemic phenomenon while using state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation, and a significant challenge which deserves the research community's urgent attention.",

Current software registry ecosystems involve multiple independent stakeholders for package management. Unfortunately, abnormal behavior and information inconsistency inevitably exist, enabling adversaries to conduct malicious activities with minimal effort covertly. In this paper, we investigate potential security vulnerabilities in six popular software registry ecosystems. Through a systematic analysis of the official registries, corresponding registry mirrors and registry clients, we identify twelve potential attack vectors, with six of them disclosed for the first time, that can be exploited to distribute malicious code stealthily. Based on these security issues, we build an analysis framework, RScouter, to continuously monitor and uncover vulnerabilities in registry ecosystems. We then utilize RScouter to conduct a measurement study spanning one year over six registries and seventeen popular mirrors, scrutinizing over 4 million packages across 53 million package versions. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that multiple threats exist in every ecosystem, and some have been exploited by attackers. We have duly reported the identified vulnerabilities to related stakeholders and received positive responses.",

      "abstract": "Open source software (OSS) supply chain enlarges the attack surface of a software system, which makes package registries attractive targets for attacks. Recently, multiple package registries have received intensified attacks with malicious packages. Of those package registries, NPM and PyPI are two of the most severe victims. Existing malicious package detectors are developed with features from a list of packages of the same ecosystem and deployed within the same ecosystem exclusively, which is infeasible to utilize the knowledge of a new malicious NPM package detected recently to detect the new malicious package in PyPI. Moreover, existing detectors lack support to model malicious behavior of OSS packages in a sequential way. To address the two limitations, we propose a single detection model using malicious behavior sequence, named Cerebro, to detect malicious packages in NPM and PyPI. We curate a feature set based on a high-level abstraction of malicious behavior to enable multi-lingual knowledge fusing. We organize extracted features into a behavior sequence to model sequential malicious behavior. We fine-tune the pre-trained language model to understand the semantics of malicious behavior. Extensive evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness of Cerebro over the state-of-the-art as well as the practically acceptable efficiency. Cerebro has detected 683 and 799 new malicious packages in PyPI and NPM, and received 707 thank letters from the official PyPI and NPM teams.",

The detection of required capabilities as well as their enforcement at runtime has been implemented and evaluated against known malicious attacks.

      "abstract": "Node.js applications are becoming more and more widely adopted on the server side, partly due to the convenience of building these applications on top of the runtime provided by popular Node.js engines and the large number of third-party packages provided by the Node Package Management (npm) registry. Node.js provides Node.js applications with system interaction capabilities using system calls. However, such convenience comes with a price, i.e., the attack surface of JavaScript arbitrary code execution (ACE) vulnerabilities is expanded to the system call level. There lies a noticeable gap between existing protection techniques in the JavaScript code level (either by code debloating or read-write-execute permission restriction) and a targeted defense for emerging critical system call level exploitation. To fill the gap, we design and implement HODOR, a lightweight runtime protection system based on enforcing precise system call restrictions when running a Node.js application. HODOR achieved this by addressing several nontrivial technical challenges. First, HODOR requires to construct high-quality call graphs for both the Node.js application (in JavaScript) and its underlying Node.js framework (in JavaScript and C/C++). Specifically, HODOR incorporates several important optimizations in both the JavaScript and C/C++ levels to improve the state-of-the-art tools for building more precise call graphs. Then, HODOR creates the main-thread whitelist and the thread-pool whitelist respectively containing the identified necessary system calls based on the call graphs mappings. Finally, with the whitelists, HODOR implements lightweight system call restriction using the Linux kernel feature Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) to shrink the attack surface. We utilize HODOR to protect 168 real-world Node.js applications compromised by arbitrary code/command execution attacks. HODOR could reduce the attack surface to 19.42% on average with negligible runtime overhead (i.e., <3%).",

Management and operation of container-based microservices is automation-heavy, leveraging on container orchestration engines such as Kubernetes (K8s). Helm is the package manager of choice for K8s and provides Charts, i.e., configuration files that define a programmatic model for application deployments. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for extracting and evaluating the security model of Helm Charts. Our proposal extracts a topological graph of the Chart, whose nodes and edges are then characterised by security features. We carry out risk assessments that refer to the attack tactics of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Furthermore, starting from these scores, we extract the riskiest attack paths. We adopt an experimental validation approach by analysing a dataset created from multiple publicly accessible Helm Chart repositories. Our methodology reveals that, in most cases, they have vulnerabilities that can be exploited through complex attack paths.",

      "title": "Estimating the Attack Surface from Residual Vulnerabilities in Open Source Software Supply Chain",
      "abstract": "Software supply chain security has now become a critical concern in the software industry (and beyond) following the large impact of recent attacks: hackers injected malicious code into Solarwinds components and Octopus scanner, which eventually infected a wide range of downstream dependencies, affecting a massive number of users. Since supply chain vulnera-bilities are a well-known concern, especially with open source systems, approaches in the literature mainly focus on identifying and patching such vulnerability. Frequently, however, a vulnerability patch is not immediately propagated to earlier releases that have been inherited by dependents, leaving residual vulnerabilities in supply chains. Our work addresses this challenge and develops a simple approach to iteratively explore the attack surface of supply chain residual vulnerabilities in open source projects. We have assessed our search scheme on 50 GitHub-hosted projects having high stars and forks: we mine their bug fix commits and identify buggy package versions to track the affected dependents and estimate the potential attack surface. We find that many projects fix their vulnerable issues by update their dependency versions, and version inheritance is a significant cause of supply chain attacks for open source projects.",

To address this issue, we propose an approach based on anomaly detection, to identify suspicious updates based on security-relevant features that attackers could use in an attack. We evaluate our approach in the context of Node.js/npm ecosystem, to show its feasibility in terms of reduced review effort and the correct identification of a confirmed malicious update attack. Although we do not expect it to be a complete solution in isolation, we believe it is an important security building block for software ecosystems.",

The complexity of today\u2019s open-source supply chains results in a significant attack surface, giving attackers numerous opportunities to reach the goal of injecting malicious code into open-source artifacts that is then downloaded and executed by victims.This work proposes a general taxonomy for attacks on open-source supply chains, independent of specific programming languages or ecosystems, and covering all supply chain stages from code contributions to package distribution. Taking the form of an attack tree, it covers 107 unique vectors, linked to 94 real-world incidents, and mapped to 33 mitigating safeguards.User surveys conducted with 17 domain experts and 134 software developers positively validated the correctness, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of the taxonomy, as well as its suitability for various use-cases. Survey participants also assessed the utility and costs of the identified safeguards, and whether they are used.",

      "abstract": "PyPI provides a convenient and accessible package management platform to developers, enabling them to quickly implement specific functions and improve work efficiency. However, the rapid development of the PyPI ecosystem has led to a severe problem of malicious package propagation. Malicious developers disguise malicious packages as normal, posing a significant security risk to end-users. To this end, we conducted an empirical study to understand the characteristics and current state of the malicious code lifecycle in the PyPI ecosystem. We first built an automated data collection framework and collated a multi-source malicious code dataset containing 4,669 malicious package files. We preliminarily classified these malicious code into five categories based on malicious behaviour characteristics. Our research found that over 50 % of malicious code exhibits multiple malicious behaviours, with information stealing and command execution being particularly prevalent. In addition, we observed several novel attack vectors and anti-detection techniques. Our analysis revealed that 74.81 % of all malicious packages successfully entered end-user projects through source code installation, thereby increasing security risks. A real-world investigation showed that many reported malicious packages persist in PyPI mirror servers globally, with over 72 % remaining for an extended period after being discovered. Finally, we sketched a portrait of the malicious code lifecycle in the PyPI ecosystem, effectively reflecting the characteristics of malicious code at different stages. We also present some suggested mitigations to improve the security of the Python open-source ecosystem.",

      "title": "Plundervolt: Software-based Fault Injection Attacks against Intel SGX",
      "abstract": "Dynamic frequency and voltage scaling features have been introduced to manage ever-growing heat and power consumption in modern processors. Design restrictions ensure frequency and voltage are adjusted as a pair, based on the current load, because for each frequency there is only a certain voltage range where the processor can operate correctly. For this purpose, many processors (including the widespread Intel Core series) expose privileged software interfaces to dynamically regulate processor frequency and operating voltage.In this paper, we demonstrate that these privileged interfaces can be reliably exploited to undermine the system\u2019s security. We present the Plundervolt attack, in which a privileged software adversary abuses an undocumented Intel Core voltage scaling interface to corrupt the integrity of Intel SGX enclave computations. Plundervolt carefully controls the processor\u2019s supply voltage during an enclave computation, inducing predictable faults within the processor package. Consequently, even Intel SGX\u2019s memory encryption/authentication technology cannot protect against Plundervolt. In multiple case studies, we show how the induced faults in enclave computations can be leveraged in real-world attacks to recover keys from cryptographic algorithms (including the AES-NI instruction set extension) or to induce memory safety vulnerabilities into bug-free enclave code. We finally discuss why mitigating Plundervolt is not trivial, requiring trusted computing base recovery through microcode updates or hardware changes.",

      "abstract": "Modern supply chain systems face significant challenges, including lack of transparency, inefficient inventory management, and vulnerability to disruptions and security threats. Traditional optimization methods often struggle to adapt to the complex and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based zero-trust supply chain security framework integrated with deep reinforcement learning (SAC-rainbow) to address these challenges. The SAC-rainbow framework leverages the Soft Actor\u2013Critic (SAC) algorithm with prioritized experience replay for inventory optimization and a blockchain-based zero-trust mechanism for secure supply chain management. The SAC-rainbow algorithm learns adaptive policies under demand uncertainty, while the blockchain architecture ensures secure, transparent, and traceable record-keeping and automated execution of supply chain transactions. An experiment using real-world supply chain data demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of reward maximization, inventory stability, and security metrics. The SAC-rainbow framework offers a promising solution for addressing the challenges of modern supply chains by leveraging blockchain, deep reinforcement learning, and zero-trust security principles. This research paves the way for developing secure, transparent, and efficient supply chain management systems in the face of growing complexity and security risks.",

      "abstract": "In most recent time, the global landscape of supply chain management has experienced unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly impacted the routine and smooth operations of different firms in the United States. This paper explains about the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the mitigation of these disruptions and possible ways of improving supply chain security and its efficiency. This research adopted a questionnaire survey involving 281 managers, with the aim to comprehensively examine the current state of AI integration across the U.S. supply chain sector, with focus on some key components like real-time tracking, cost optimization, and risk management. A mixed method approach was adopted for this research, utilizing both inferential and descriptive analyses to unravel insights and trends into the role of AI in enhancing supply chain security. The results indicate that integrating AI, most especially through cost optimization, real-time tracking, and risk management components, emerges as a significant determinant of supply chain security in the United States. Real-time tracking technologies are identified as crucial for monitoring shipments and assets, enabling quick responses to security incidents, and ensuring end-to-end visibility throughout the supply chain. Despite the potential benefits, the study highlights challenges that hinder the widespread integration of AI technologies in the U.S. supply chain. The high cost of AI adoption and the limited availability of skilled personnel are major obstacles. To address these challenges, the paper proposes practical recommendations. Firstly, real-time tracking technologies are recommended to monitor shipments and assets, facilitating rapid responses to security incidents, and ensuring visibility across the entire supply chain. Furthermore, the paper suggests optimizing costs by investing in cost-effective security solutions. This includes leveraging AI for automated monitoring systems and adopting secure packaging measures. These strategies aim to minimize vulnerabilities without compromising security standards, offering a balanced approach to enhancing supply chain security while mitigating the financial implications associated with AI adoption.",

      "abstract": "The increasing scale and complexity of global supply chains have led to new challenges spanning various fields, such as supply chain disruptions due to long waiting lines at the ports, material shortages, and inflation. Coupled with the size of supply chains and the availability of vast amounts of data, efforts towards tackling such challenges have led to an increasing interest in applying machine learning methods in many aspects of supply chains. Unlike other solutions, ML techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks, make predictions and approximate optimal solutions faster. This paper presents an automated ML framework to enhance supply chain security by detecting fraudulent activities, predicting maintenance needs, and forecasting material backorders. Using datasets of varying sizes, results show that fraud detection achieves an 88% accuracy rate using sampling methods, machine failure prediction reaches 93.4% accuracy, and material backorder prediction achieves 89.3% accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the performance of these models, with certain supervised techniques like XGBoost and LightGBM reaching up to 100% precision. This research contributes to supply chain security by streamlining data preprocessing, feature selection, model optimization, and inference deployment, addressing critical challenges and boosting operational efficiency.",

This research subject is concerned both with the security of infrastructures used to build software and deliver it to end users and with the security of software that contains external dependencies such as third-party packages and libraries, and its chief goal is to ensure that no vulnerabilities are introduced in the path between developers and users. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review to identify knowledge gaps in software supply chain security. For this, we considered studies published between 2012 and 2023 in the search engines of IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Engineering Village, Scopus, and arXiv. Of the 2051 studies obtained in the primary survey, only 85 are relevant for this research. Analyzing the studies, we observed gaps such as little discussion of software supply chains that involve cloud components, few proposals focused on the software distribution process, and a lack of use of threat modeling frameworks to help identify threats to the supply chain and validate the results.",

      "abstract": "This review examines how blockchain technology can be leveraged to enhance data privacy and security in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). As global supply chains become increasingly complex and the demand for sustainability grows, ensuring data privacy and security has become a critical concern. Traditional supply chain systems often face challenges such as data breaches, lack of transparency, and difficulty in tracing products and materials. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, and transparent architecture, offers a promising solution to these challenges. Blockchain can enhance data security by ensuring that data is tamper-proof, traceable, and encrypted, thus protecting sensitive information across the supply chain. It provides transparency while allowing permissioned access, ensuring that stakeholders can verify data without exposing confidential information. Furthermore, privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption allow verification of data without compromising its security. Smart contracts enable automated compliance with regulatory frameworks like GDPR, reducing the risk of human error and improving operational efficiency. The integration of blockchain in SSCM can improve traceability, transparency, and accountability, thereby promoting environmental and social sustainability. By tracking the origin and journey of goods, blockchain helps verify ethical sourcing practices and reduce carbon footprints. However, the technology also presents challenges, including scalability, integration with legacy systems, and cost considerations. Through case studies in industries such as food, textiles, and renewable energy, this review highlights the practical applications and benefits of blockchain for SSCM. It concludes that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize supply chain operations, but careful consideration must be given to overcoming its technical and financial barriers to widespread adoption.",

      "title": "An Empirical Study on Using Large Language Models to Analyze Software Supply Chain Security Failures",
      "abstract": "As we increasingly depend on software systems, the consequences of breaches in the software supply chain become more severe. High-profile cyber attacks like SolarWinds and ShadowHammer have resulted in significant financial and data losses, underlining the need for stronger cybersecurity. One way to prevent future breaches is by studying past failures. However, traditional methods of analyzing past failures require manually reading and summarizing reports about them. Automated support could reduce costs and allow analysis of more failures. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs) could be leveraged to assist the analysis of failures. In this study, we assessed the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze historical software supply chain breaches. We used LLMs to replicate the manual analysis of 69 software supply chain security failures performed by members of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). We developed prompts for LLMs to categorize these by four dimensions: type of compromise, intent, nature, and impact. GPT 3.5's categorizations had an average accuracy of 68% and Bard's had an accuracy of 58% over these dimensions. We report that LLMs effectively characterize software supply chain failures when the source articles are detailed enough for consensus among manual analysts, but cannot yet replace human analysts. Future work can improve LLM performance in this context, and study a broader range of articles and failures.",

      "abstract": "The 2020 Solarwinds attack was a tipping point that caused a heightened awareness about the security of the software supply chain and in particular the large amount of trust placed in build systems. Reproducible Builds (R-Bs) provide a strong foundation to build defenses for arbitrary attacks against build systems by ensuring that given the same source code, build environment, and build instructions, bitwise-identical artifacts are created. Unfortunately, much of the software industry believes R-Bs are too far out of reach for most projects. The goal of this paper is to help identify a path for R-Bs to become a commonplace property.To this end, we conducted a series of 24 semi-structured expert interviews with participants from the Reproducible-Builds.org project, finding that self-effective work by highly motivated developers and collaborative communication with upstream projects are key contributors to R-Bs. We identified a range of motivations that can encourage open source developers to strive for R-Bs, including indicators of quality, security benefits, and more efficient caching of artifacts. We also identify experiences that help and hinder adoption, which often revolves around communication with upstream projects. We conclude with recommendations on how to better integrate R-Bs with the efforts of the open source and free software community.",

      "abstract": "Many software supply chain attacks exploit the fact that what is in a source code repository may not match the artifact that is actually deployed in one's system. This paper describes a logic-based framework that analyzes a software component and its dependencies to determine if they are built in a trustworthy fashion. The properties that are checked include the availability of build provenances and whether the build and deployment process of an artifact is tamper resistant. These properties are based on the open-source community efforts, such as SLSA, that enable an incremental approach to improve supply chain security. We evaluate our tool on the top-30 Java, Python, and npm open-source projects and show that the majority still do not produce provenances. Our evaluation also shows that a large number of open-source Java and Python projects do not have a transparent build platform to produce artifacts, which is a necessary requirement to increase the trust in the published artifacts. We show that our tool fills a gap in the current software supply chain security landscape, and by making it publicly available the open-source community can both benefit from and contribute to it.",

      "abstract": "Food safety is a fundamental right in modern societies. One of the most pressing problems nowadays is the provenance of food and food-related products that citizens consume, mainly due to several food scares and the globalization of food markets, which has resulted in food supply chains that extend beyond nations or even continent boundaries. Food supply networks are characterized by high complexity and a lack of openness. There is a critical requirement for applying novel techniques to verify and authenticate the origin, quality parameters, and transfer/storage details associated with food. This study portrays an end-to-end approach to enhance the security of the food supply chain and thus increase the trustfulness of the food industry. The system aims at increasing the transparency of food supply chain monitoring systems through securing all components that those consist of. A universal information monitoring scheme based on blockchain technology ensures the integrity of collected data, a self-sovereign identity approach for all supply chain actors ensures the minimization of single points of failure, and finally, a security mechanism, that is based on the use of TinyML\u2019s nascent technology, is embedded in monitoring devices to mitigate a significant portion of malicious behavior from actors in the supply chain.",

      "abstract": "The rapid improvement in the global connectivity standards has escalated the level of trade taking place among different parties. Advanced communication standards are allowing the trade of all types of commodities and services. Furthermore, the goods and services developed in a particular region are transcending boundaries to enter into foreign markets. Supply chains play an essential role in the trade of these goods. To be able to realize a connected world with no boundary restrictions in terms of goods and services, it is imperative to keep the associated supply chains transparent, secure, and trustworthy. Therefore, some fundamental changes in the current supply chain architecture are essential to achieve a secure trade environment. This article discusses the supply chain\u2019s security-critical application areas and presents a detailed survey of the security issues in the existing supply chain architecture. Various emerging technologies, such as blockchain, machine learning (ML), and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as solutions to the vulnerabilities in the existing infrastructure of the supply chain have also been discussed. Recent studies reviewed in this work reveal a growing sentiment in the industry toward new and emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and ML. While many organizations have already adopted IoT applications and artificial intelligence systems in their businesses, widespread adoption of blockchain remains distant. It has also been found that over the past decade, PUF-based authentication systems have gained much ground. However, a proper reference model for their implementation in complex supply chains is still missing.",

The proposed research explored the mediating effect of supply chain risk in the logistics and distribution industry, providing unique insights for future research, literature, and targeted sectors. A descriptive, causal and analytical design with quantitative research technique was applied to the proposed research model. A sample of 301 respondents from the managerial departments of 176 logistics and distribution companies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi was used to assess the research variables. The findings revealed that the impact of information systems was positively associated with the e-supply chain, while the indirect impact of supply chain risk significantly positively impacted the e-supply chain. The research is limited to assessing the supply chain risk as an intermediary. For future research, exploring the SC risk prevention strategies' impact on the E-supply chain is recommended. Research findings are anticipated to assist communities of practice in making better information security decisions in the context of e-supply chain by clearly implementing information security policies internally and externally to enhance e-supply chain performance and SC risk management.",

In this paper, we make the case that developing practical solutions is not possible until the community has a holistic view of the security problem; this view must include both the technical and procedural aspects. To this end, we examine three use cases to identify common security goals, and present a goal-oriented taxonomy of existing solutions demonstrating a holistic overview of software supply chain security.",

      "title": "Cyber Threat Predictive Analytics for Improving Cyber Supply Chain Security",
      "abstract": "Cyber Supply Chain (CSC) system is complex which involves different sub-systems performing various tasks. Security in supply chain is challenging due to the inherent vulnerabilities and threats from any part of the system which can be exploited at any point within the supply chain. This can cause a severe disruption on the overall business continuity. Therefore, it is paramount important to understand and predicate the threats so that organization can undertake necessary control measures for the supply chain security. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides an intelligence analysis to discover unknown to known threats using various properties including threat actor skill and motivation, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure (TT and P), and Indicator of Compromise (IoC). This paper aims to analyse and predicate threats to improve cyber supply chain security. We have applied Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyse and predict the threats based on the CTI properties. That allows to identify the inherent CSC vulnerabilities so that appropriate control actions can be undertaken for the overall cybersecurity improvement. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, CTI data is gathered and a number of ML algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression (LG), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), are used to develop predictive analytics using the Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset. The experiment considers attack and TTP as input parameters and vulnerabilities and Indicators of compromise (IoC) as output parameters. The results relating to the prediction reveal that Spyware/Ransomware and spear phishing are the most predictable threats in CSC. We have also recommended relevant controls to tackle these threats. We advocate using CTI data for the ML predicate model for the overall CSC cyber security improvement.",

      "title": "Distributed Ledger Technologies in Supply Chain Security Management: A Comprehensive Survey",
      "abstract": "Supply chains (SC) present performance bottlenecks that contribute to a high level of costs, infiltration of product quality, and impact productivity. Examples of such inhibitors include the bullwhip effect, new product lines, high inventory, and restrictive data flows. These bottlenecks can force manufacturers to source more raw materials and increase production significantly. Also, restrictive data flow in a complex global SC network generally slows down the movement of goods and services. The use of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in SC management (SCM) demonstrates the potentials to reduce these bottlenecks through transparency, decentralization, and optimizations in data management. These technologies promise to enhance the trustworthiness of entities within the SC, ensure the accuracy of data-driven operations, and enable existing SCM processes to migrate from a linear to a fully circular economy. This article presents a comprehensive review of 111 articles published in the public domain in the use and efficacy of DLT in SC. It acts as a roadmap for current and future researchers who focus on SC security management to better understand the integration of digital technologies such as DLT. We clustered these articles using standard descriptors linked to trustworthiness, namely, immutability, transparency, traceability, and integrity.",

      "abstract": "Open source components are ubiquitous in companies\u2019 setups, processes, and software. Utilizing these external components as building blocks enables companies to leverage the benefits of open source software, allowing them to focus their efforts on features and faster delivery instead of writing their own components. But by introducing these components into their software stack, companies inherit unique security challenges and attack surfaces: including code from potentially unvetted contributors and obligations to assess and mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities in external components.In 25 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with software developers, architects, and engineers from industry projects, we investigate their projects\u2019 processes, decisions, and considerations in the context of external open source code. We find that open source components play an important role in many of our participants\u2019 projects, that most projects have some form of company policy or at least best practice for including external code, and that many developers wish for more developer-hours, dedicated teams, or tools to better audit included components. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for company stakeholders and the open source software ecosystem. Overall, we appeal to companies to not treat the open source ecosystem as a free (software) supply chain and instead to contribute towards the health and security of the overall software ecosystem they benefit from and are part of.",

      "abstract": "Reusable software libraries, frameworks, and components, such as those provided by open source ecosystems and third-party suppliers, accelerate digital innovation. However, recent years have shown almost exponential growth in attackers leveraging these software artifacts to launch software supply chain attacks. Past well-known software supply chain attacks include the SolarWinds, log4j, and xz utils incidents. Supply chain attacks are considered to have three major attack vectors: through vulnerabilities and malware accidentally or intentionally injected into open source and third-party dependencies/components/containers; by infiltrating the build infrastructure during the build and deployment processes; and through targeted techniques aimed at the humans involved in software development, such as through social engineering. Plummeting trust in the software supply chain could decelerate digital innovation if the software industry reduces its use of open source and third-party artifacts to reduce risks. This article contains perspectives and knowledge obtained from intentional outreach with practitioners to understand their practical challenges and from extensive research efforts. We then provide an overview of current research efforts to secure the software supply chain. Finally, we propose a future research agenda to close software supply chain attack vectors and support the software industry.",

      "abstract": "The cyber supply chain has been a target of sophisticated attacks. Vulnerabilities in components that were once considered secure due to perceived trusting relationships are being exploited. One way to reduce this type of cyber risk is through the use of a Zero Trust architecture. This type of approach revises trust in all relationships. It disregards the implicit trust in any component and is based on the premise of the existence of internal threats to the corporate network. The present work proposes to integrate a Zero Trust architecture in a cyber supply chain. The main contribution of this study is to propose an organization of security controls for a cyber supply chain in domains, enabling improvements in the security of the cyber supply chain by applying the principles of a Zero Trust architecture. The study also provides a checklist of controls that allows a gap analysis and suggests some ways of visualizing this result.",

A research on the supply chain security risk management based on ISO 28001 security supply chain is conducted to overcome such problems. The purpose of this research is to analyse compliance & supply chain security risks and propose a mitigation based on ISO 28001 in a logistic service provider in Indonesia. A gap analysis is conducted to assess the compliance of security performance in seven areas, i.e. supply chain security management, security plans, asset security, personnel security, information security, security of goods & conveyance and transportation units closed cargo. The result of the assessment showed that a compliance level of above 75% indicates that the company is ready to implement an ISO 28001. The risk mitigation plan is proposed based on Failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) which calculates the Risk Priority Number (RPN). The RPN value indicates the level of risk where the higher the value, the more critical the risk and become the priority to handle. The mitigation proposed for managing risk are reducing, sharing and avoiding.",

      "abstract": "The globalization of the semiconductor supply chain introduces ever-increasing security and privacy risks. Two major concerns are IP theft through reverse engineering and malicious modification of the design. The latter concern in part relies on successful reverse engineering of the design as well. IC camouflaging and logic locking are two of the techniques under research that can thwart reverse engineering by end-users or foundries. However, developing low overhead locking/camouflaging schemes that can resist the ever-evolving state-of-the-art attacks has been a challenge for several years. This article provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art with respect to locking/camouflaging techniques. We start by defining a systematic threat model for these techniques and discuss how various real-world scenarios relate to each threat model. We then discuss the evolution of generic algorithmic attacks under each threat model eventually leading to the strongest existing attacks. The article then systematizes defences and along the way discusses attacks that are more specific to certain kinds of locking/camouflaging. The article then concludes by discussing open problems and future directions.",

This article provides the first comprehensive research agenda of the LLM supply chain, offering a structured approach to identify critical challenges and opportunities through the dual lenses of software engineering (SE) and security and privacy (S&P). We begin by establishing a clear definition of the LLM supply chain, encompassing its components and dependencies. We then analyze each layer of the supply chain, presenting a vision for robust and secure LLM development, reviewing the current state of practices and technologies, and identifying key challenges and research opportunities.

      "abstract": "The innovation of blockchain technologies into supply chain management is incremental by nature, attending to waste aspects and issues that are very old within SCM. As such, this reflection seeks to highlight the multifaceted benefits of blockchain in enhancing simplicity, traceability, security, and efficiency within supply chains. Blockchain provides a decentralized, permanent system of record that allows trust and honesty between partners; all valuable information is recorded in an imperishable way. Moreover, intelligent contracts mechanize some forms involved in supply chains, such as the processing of payments and inventory management, which reduces to a large extent not only regulatory costs but also human error. The high level of security measures is ensured by blockchain\u2019s ability to encrypt this data and thus ensure information availability in case of sophisticated cyber threats. Such improvement in security reduces extortion and tampering, providing a more secure supply chain. This innovation further simplifies the administrative compliance, providing an accessible, verifiable record of each exchange. Not only this, but it also offers a way to verify whether material sources and technical support standards meet prevailing standards, thereby promoting brand identity to customers for the brand marked on a product and enhancing customer trust in a brand.",

      "abstract": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution has transformed industries and supply chains by integrating advanced operations, tools, and logistics services. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, particularly in ensuring data dependability, security, and operational efficiency. Digital twins (DTs), which replicate real-world components and processes, have emerged as essential tools for enhancing predictive analytics, simulation, and product lifecycle management in Industry 4.0. However, traditional DT development relies on centralized systems, which are vulnerable to data tampering and security breaches, especially in the management of transaction logs and historical data. To address these challenges, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of integrating blockchain with DTs. Using a qualitative research methodology, including desk research, case studies, and interviews with industry experts, we analyze various blockchain-based DT applications across industries and specifically in supply chain management. The findings reveal that blockchain-enhanced DTs can significantly improve data integrity, traceability, and security, thus boosting operational efficiency and quality control in supply chains. Additionally, this study identifies key integration techniques and the role of blockchain in automating processes through smart contracts. This review provides insights into the practical implications of blockchain-based DTs, highlighting their potential to enhance the reliability and scalability of Industry 4.0 operations.",

In Industry 4.0 era, a cyber-attack becomes unavoidable and needs to adopt cyber supply chain risk management to improve the firm. The data were collected from 105 firms in Malaysia through online surveys. The partial least squares structural equation modeling technique examined the model\u2019s goodness and research hypothesis. The results revealed that operations, directly and indirectly, influence (via mediators) supply chain performance. In contrast, governance directly affects supply chain flexibility and indirect (via mediators) influence on supply chain performance; in addition, systems integration did not, directly, and indirectly, influence supply chain performance. This framework indicates the manufacturing industry and related parties with a better understanding of cyber supply chain risk management. Graphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "Purpose: The research explored empirical evidence to assess the impact of cyber security and supply chain risk on digital operations in the UAE pharmaceutical industry. \nMethodology/Design/Approach: Based on responses from 243 personnel working at 14 pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Dubai, data were examined for normality, instrument validity and regression analysis. Cyber security and SC risk on digital operations were explored by applying convenient sampling and descriptive and analytical research design. \nFindings: The findings validated the significant positive association between cyber security and supply chain risk with digital operations. \nResearch implications and Limitations: The research model was developed with three variables evaluated only on the pharmaceutical industry in Dubai. Future research should focus on multiple manufacturing industries by covering a larger geographic area. \nPractical implications: When suppliers are highly concentrated, customer-focused organisations with uncertain levels of digital transformation could improve their ability to manage supply chain risk by diversifying their clients. Pharmaceutical firms may require a greater focus on technology-based manufacturing firms to build and maintain customer trust. \nOriginality Value: To illustrate how the pharmaceutical industry has explored the relationship between cyber security, supply chain risk and digital operations, the research highlights the significant and convoluted consequences of the relationship model that have not been previously considered.",

      "abstract": "Research and industry are rapidly advancing the innovation and adoption of foundation model-based systems, yet the tools for managing these models have not kept pace. Understanding the provenance and lineage of models is critical for researchers, industry, regulators, and public trust. While model cards and system cards were designed to provide transparency, they fall short in key areas: tracing model genealogy, enabling machine readability, offering reliable centralized management systems, and fostering consistent creation incentives. This challenge mirrors issues in software supply chain security, but AI/ML remains at an earlier stage of maturity. Addressing these gaps requires industry-standard tooling that can be adopted by foundation model publishers, open-source model innovators, and major distribution platforms. We propose a machine-readable model specification format to simplify the creation of model records, thereby reducing error-prone human effort, notably when a new model inherits most of its design from a foundation model. Our solution explicitly traces relationships between upstream and downstream models, enhancing transparency and traceability across the model lifecycle. To facilitate the adoption, we introduce the unified model record (UMR) repository , a semantically versioned system that automates the publication of model records to multiple formats (PDF, HTML, LaTeX) and provides a hosted web interface (https://modelrecord.com/). This proof of concept aims to set a new standard for managing foundation models, bridging the gap between innovation and responsible model management.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture and livestock play a vital role in social and economic stability. Food safety and transparency in the food supply chain are a significant concern for many people. Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain are gaining attention due to their success in versatile applications. They generate a large amount of data that can be optimized and used efficiently by advanced deep learning (ADL) techniques. The importance of such innovations from the viewpoint of supply chain management is significant in different processes such as for broadened visibility, provenance, digitalization, disintermediation, and smart contracts. This article takes the secure IoT\u2013blockchain data of Industry 4.0 in the food sector as a research object. Using ADL techniques, we propose a hybrid model based on recurrent neural networks (RNN). Therefore, we used long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) as a prediction model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization jointly to optimize the parameters of the hybrid model. We select the optimal training parameters by GA and finally cascade LSTM with GRU. We evaluated the performance of the proposed system for a different number of users. This paper aims to help supply chain practitioners to take advantage of the state-of-the-art technologies; it will also help the industry to make policies according to the predictions of ADL.",

      "title": "Deepro: Provenance-based APT Campaigns Detection via GNN",
      "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are typically sophisticated, stealthy and long-term attacks that are difficult to be detected and investigated. Recently proposed provenance graph based on system audit logs has become an important approach for APT detection and investigation. However, existing provenance-based approaches that either require rules based on expert knowledge or cannot pinpoint attack events in a provenance graph still cannot effectively mitigate APT attacks. In this paper, we present Deepro, a provenance-based APT campaign detection approach that not only effectively detects attack-relevant entities in a provenance graph but also precisely recovers APT campaigns based on the detected entities. Specifically, Deepro first customizes a general purpose GNN (Graph Neural Network) model to represent and detect process nodes in a provenance graph through automatically learning different patterns of attack behaviors and benign behaviors using the rich contextual information in the provenance graph. Then, Deepro further detects attack-relevant file and network entities according to their data dependencies with the detected process nodes. Finally, Deepro recovers APT campaigns through correlating detected entities based on their causality relationships in the provenance graph. We evaluated Deepro with ten real-world APT attacks. The evaluation result shows that Deepro can effectively detect attack events with an average 98.81% F1-score and thus produces precise provenance sub-graphs of APT attacks.",

      "abstract": "There has recently been a lot of ongoing research in the areas of fairness, bias and explainability of machine learning (ML) models due to the self-evident or regulatory requirements of various ML applications. We make the following observation: All of these approaches require a robust understanding of the relationship between ML models and the data used to train them. In this work, we introduce the ML provenance tracking problem: the fundamental idea is to automatically track which columns in a dataset have been used to derive the features/labels of an ML model. We discuss the challenges in capturing such information in the context of Python, the most common language used by data scientists. We then present Vamsa, a modular system that extracts provenance from Python scripts without requiring any changes to the users' code. Using 26K real data science scripts, we verify the effectiveness of Vamsa in terms of coverage, and performance. We also evaluate Vamsa's accuracy on a smaller subset of manually labeled data. Our analysis shows that Vamsa's precision and recall range from 90.4% to 99.1% and its latency is in the order of milliseconds for average size scripts. Drawing from our experience in deploying ML models in production, we also present an example in which Vamsa helps automatically identify models that are affected by data corruption issues.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across various domains, including chatbots and auto-task completion agents. However, these models are susceptible to safety vulnerabilities such as jailbreaking, prompt injection, and privacy leakage attacks. These vulnerabilities can lead to the generation of malicious content, unauthorized actions, or the disclosure of confidential information. While foundational LLMs undergo alignment training and incorporate safety measures, they are often subject to fine-tuning, or doing quantization resource-constrained environments. This study investigates the impact of these modifications on LLM safety, a critical consideration for building reliable and secure AI systems. We evaluate foundational models including Mistral, Llama series, Qwen, and MosaicML, along with their fine-tuned variants. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that fine-tuning generally increases the success rates of jailbreak attacks, while quantization has variable effects on attack success rates. Importantly, we find that properly implemented guardrails significantly enhance resistance to jailbreak attempts. These findings contribute to our understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing more robust safety strategies in the deployment of language models.",

      "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively fine-tune an large language model (LLM) without the need of direct data sharing. Ideally, by training on decentralized data that is aligned with human preferences and safety principles, federated instruction tuning can result in an LLM that could behave in a helpful and safe manner. In this paper, we for the first time reveal the vulnerability of safety alignment in FedIT by proposing a simple, stealthy, yet effective safety attack method. Specifically, the malicious clients could automatically generate attack data without involving manual efforts and attack the FedIT system by training their local LLMs on such attack data. Unfortunately, this proposed safety attack not only can compromise the safety alignment of LLM trained via FedIT, but also can not be effectively defended against by many existing FL defense methods. Targeting this, we further propose a post-hoc defense method, which could rely on a fully automated pipeline: generation of defense data and further fine-tuning of the LLM. Extensive experiments show that our safety attack method can significantly compromise the LLM's safety alignment (e.g., reduce safety rate by 70\\%), which can not be effectively defended by existing defense methods (at most 4\\% absolute improvement), while our safety defense method can significantly enhance the attacked LLM's safety alignment (at most 69\\% absolute improvement).",

      "abstract": "Language modelling has demonstrated the exceptional interpretation and analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in addressing a wide range of Natural Language Processings (NLPs) tasks. However, LLMs still face challenges in technical network text analysis due to its special terminology, syntax, and protocols which are not consistent with conventional human language. In this paper, we introduce a method for fine-tuning NLP-based LLMs on technical network text intended for machine comprehension. We apply our method to detect and classify different types of attacks in network traffic flows. To validate our method, we used the Kitsune Network Attack Dataset and our results show that our method is able to correctly classify the network attacks, even in adverse conditions, when the model receives irrelevant context for classification. This study highlights how the capabilities of LLMs can be extended across different unknown domains, specifically cyber security, thereby enhancing their ability to detect anomalies, classify them, and distinguish between various types of attacks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform non-fine-tuned models, underlining the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs for cyber security applications involving the analysis of technical text data.",

We further refine this knowledge representation through fine-tuning to form a classifier focused on malicious code detection. Evaluation results on an open-source malicious code dataset indicate that our model's performance not only surpasses traditional machine learning methods, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but also outperforms popular open-source security tools and significantly exceeds advanced detection models designed for other programming languages. Despite our model's smaller scale, limited by the amount of data and model parameters, it demonstrates exceptional performance on the test dataset, far exceeding traditional machine learning techniques. This achievement highlights the strong potential of our model in the analysis of source code security and provides new directions and possibilities for future research in this field.",

To address the low accuracy of existing vulnerability prediction methods and the inefficiency of vulnerability detection, this paper proposes a directed greybox fuzzing method for power system terminal firmware based on vulnerability prediction. The proposed method consists of two main parts: (1) vulnerability point prediction and (2) directed greybox fuzzing targeting these vulnerability points. For vulnerability point prediction, a pretrained vulnerability prediction model is constructed to predict potential vulnerabilities in the target program. The regions with higher vulnerability scores are more likely to contain bugs. In fuzzing, the initial test case generation and mutation strategies are improved to account for power-specific protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively enhances the accuracy of vulnerability point prediction and improves vulnerability detection efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain presents a chance to address the security and privacy issues of the Internet of Things; however, blockchain itself has certain security issues. How to accurately identify smart contract vulnerabilities is one of the key issues at hand. Most existing methods require large-scale data support to avoid overfitting; machine learning (ML) models trained on small-scale vulnerability data are often difficult to produce satisfactory results in smart contract vulnerability prediction. However, in the real world, collecting contractual vulnerability data requires huge human and time costs. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposed an ensemble learning (EL)-based contract vulnerability prediction method, which is based on seven different neural networks using contract vulnerability data for contract-level vulnerability detection. Seven neural network (NN) models were first pretrained using an information graph (IG) consisting of source datasets, which then were integrated into an ensemble model called Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection method based on Information Graph and Ensemble Learning (SCVDIE). The effectiveness of the SCVDIE model was verified using a target dataset composed of IG, and then its performances were compared with static tools and seven independent data-driven methods. The verification and comparison results show that the proposed SCVDIE method has higher accuracy and robustness than other data-driven methods in the target task of predicting smart contract vulnerabilities.",

By utilizing the Anthropic Red-team dataset, we analyze major risk categories, including Information Hazards, Malicious Uses, and Discrimination/Hateful content. Our findings indicate that LLMs tend to consider Information Hazards less harmful, a finding confirmed by a specially developed regression model. Additionally, our analysis shows that LLMs respond less stringently to Information Hazards compared to other risks.

The FTA system is used to transfer mass amounts of data quickly and efficiently between multiple systems. Once Accellion's appliance was breached, malicious actors copied data and threatened to release the data onto the internet if not paid a ransom. In order to prevent this from taking place, Accellion, as well as multiple client companies, assisted breached establishments with defense solutions, customer support, and ransom advice. Our findings indicate that Accellion was breached through four separate exploits. The main hacking methodology used was an SQL injection. Once into the system, attackers could view which transferred data was sensitive due to it being flagged with a special \u201csensitive\u201d mark. Our findings are valuable because they express how companies should go about handling ransomware attacks. Our findings also indicate a solution for this type of attack and how a company should respond if they are faced with a ransomware attack.",

      "abstract": "With the development of deep learning and federated learning (FL), federated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) based on deep learning have played a significant role in securing industrial control systems (ICSs). However, adversarial attacks on ICSs may compromise the ability of deep learning\u2010based IDSs to accurately detect cyberattacks, leading to serious consequences. Moreover, in the process of generating adversarial samples, the selection of replacement models lacks an effective method, which may not fully expose the vulnerabilities of the models. The authors first propose an automated FL\u2010based method to generate adversarial samples in ICSs, called AFL\u2010GAS, which uses the principle of transfer attack and fully considers the importance of replacement models during the process of adversarial sample generation. In the proposed AFL\u2010GAS method, a lightweight neural architecture search method is developed to find the optimised replacement model composed of a combination of four lightweight basic blocks. Then, to enhance the adversarial robustness, the authors propose a multi\u2010objective neural architecture search\u2010based IDS method against adversarial attacks in ICSs, called MoNAS\u2010IDSAA, by considering both classification performance on regular samples and adversarial robustness simultaneously. The experimental results on three widely used intrusion detection datasets in ICSs, such as secure water treatment (SWaT), Water Distribution, and Power System Attack, demonstrate that the proposed AFL\u2010GAS method has obvious advantages in evasion rate and lightweight compared with other four methods. Besides, the proposed MoNAS\u2010IDSAA method not only has a better classification performance, but also has obvious advantages in model adversarial robustness compared with one manually designed federated adversarial learning\u2010based IDS method.",

      "title": "ThreatPilot: Attack-Driven Threat Intelligence Extraction",
      "abstract": "Efficient defense against dynamically evolving advanced persistent threats (APT) requires the structured threat intelligence feeds, such as techniques used. However, existing threat-intelligence extraction techniques predominantly focuses on individual pieces of intelligence-such as isolated techniques or atomic indicators-resulting in fragmented and incomplete representations of real-world attacks. This granularity inherently limits on both the depth and the contextual richness of the extracted intelligence, making it difficult for downstream security systems to reason about multi-step behaviors or to generate actionable detections. To address this gap, we propose to extract the layered Attack-driven Threat Intelligence (ATIs), a comprehensive representation that captures the full spectrum of adversarial behavior. We propose ThreatPilot, which can accurately identify the AITs including complete tactics, techniques, multi-step procedures, and their procedure variants, and integrate the threat intelligence to software security application scenarios: the detection rules (i.e., Sigma) and attack command can be generated automatically to a more accuracy level. Experimental results on 1,769 newly crawly reports and 16 manually calibrated reports show ThreatPilot's effectiveness in identifying accuracy techniques, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches of AttacKG by 1.34X in F1 score. Further studies upon 64,185 application logs via Honeypot show that our Sigma rule generator significantly outperforms several existing rules-set in detecting the real-world malicious events. Industry partners confirm that our Sigma rule generator can significantly help save time and costs of the rule generation process. In addition, our generated commands achieve an execution rate of 99.3%, compared to 50.3% without the extracted intelligence.",

      "abstract": "During the past two decades, oil and gas operational and information technology systems have experienced constant digital growth, closely followed by an increasing number of cyber-attacks on the newly interconnected systems. Adversaries exploit vulnerable accessible device or malware attacks networked services, in an attempt to gain access to critical systems and machinery that are interconnected over networks. Given the importance of the oil and gas sector on the global economy and the diversity of critical systems often being controlled over remote locations, it is highly important to understand and mitigate such attacks. In this paper, we survey cyber-attacks on all three domains of the oil and gas sector (upstream, midstream, downstream) starting from the early 90s up until 2020. For each domain, we document and analyze verified attacks based on real-world reports and published demo attacks on systems. We map and catalogue the attack types used in each case, in order to understand common and subliminal attack paths against oil and gas critical operations. Our aim is threefold, i.e., first, to assess documented attacks using standardized impact assessment techniques and highlight potential consequences of cyber-attacks on this sector, second, to build a vulnerability taxonomy based on technical knowledge gathered by all such incidents and connect each vulnerability with oil and gas systems and respective attack paths, and third, to map the documented knowledge and taxonomies with MITRE\u2019s international knowledge base of Adversary Tactics and Techniques, so as to provide a general guide for analyzing and protecting against cyber-attacks at oil and gas infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to deploy a custom backdoor on to a target machine (Metasploit/Windows) from the source machine (Kali Linux) in a virtual environment (Hypervisor -Windows). For the Virtual system, a wired network is used. The overall goal of the project is to deploy malware such as a backdoor, on devices connected to the infected network, to showcase the threat posed by such malicious software. This work proposes a framework for the AI-based deployment of effective custom backdoors within a virtualized environment. The local virtualization platforms have leveraged to create scalable, isolated, and reproducible sandboxes for backdoor research. This is achieved by carrying out an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing attack. It is followed by manipulation of DNS (Domain Name System) server response to redirect the victim to a malicious site or intercept HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) response to enable downloading of malicious files on the target system. Hence, the trojan downloaded can be of any form, like a key-logger or Backdoor. The Backdoor will help us get full system access to the target site and we will be able to download and upload files on or from the target machine, thus effectively creating a backdoor.",

      "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have caused significant losses across a wide range of sectors, including the theft of sensitive data and harm to system integrity. As attack techniques grow increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, the arms race between cyber defenders and attackers continues to intensify. The revolutionary impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up numerous opportunities in various fields, including cybersecurity. An intriguing question arises: can the extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs be harnessed for provenance analysis and play a positive role in identifying previously unknown malicious events? To seek a deeper understanding of this issue, we propose a new strategy for taking advantage of LLMs in provenance-based threat detection. In our design, the state-of-the-art LLM offers additional details in provenance data interpretation, leveraging their knowledge of system calls, software identity, and high-level understanding of application execution context. The advanced contextualized embedding capability is further utilized to capture the rich semantics of event descriptions. We comprehensively examine the quality of the resulting embeddings, and it turns out that they offer promising avenues. Subsequently, machine learning models built upon these embeddings demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world data. In our evaluation, supervised threat detection achieves a precision of 99.0%, and semi-supervised anomaly detection attains a precision of 96.9%.",

      "abstract": "Network slicing is envisaged as the key to unlocking revenue growth in 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. However, the dynamic nature of network slicing and the growing sophistication of DDoS attacks rises the menace of reshaping a stealthy DDoS into an Economical Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attack. EDoS aims at incurring economic damages to service provider due to the increased elastic use of resources. Motivated by the limitations of existing defense solutions, we propose FortisEDoS, a novel framework that aims at enabling elastic B5G services that are impervious to EDoS attacks. FortisEDoS integrates a new deep learning-powered DDoS anomaly detection model, dubbed CG-GRU, that capitalizes on the capabilities of emerging graph and recurrent neural networks in capturing spatio-temporal correlations to accurately discriminate malicious behavior. Furthermore, FortisEDoS leverages transfer learning to effectively defeat EDoS attacks in newly deployed slices by exploiting the knowledge learned in a previously deployed slice. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CG-GRU in achieving higher detection performance of more than 92% with lower computation complexity. They show also that transfer learning can yield an attack detection sensitivity of above 91%, while accelerating the training process by at least 61%. Further analysis shows that FortisEDoS exhibits intuitive explainability of its decisions, fostering trust in deep learning-assisted systems.",

      "abstract": "The critical energy infrastructure is undergoing two significant transformations: the rapid increase in renewable distributed energy resources (DER) and the digitalization of the energy sector, collectively shaping what is known as the Internet of Energy (IoE). Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a widely adopted tool for effectively allocating energy and managing sector-related resources, where ensuring fairness is essential. While inherent unfairness in AI systems is well acknowledged, little attention has been given to evaluating this unfairness and its real-world implications within the context of the IoE. In this study, we take a first step to elucidate the unfairness in AI-powered IoE systems induced by malicious users. We introduce Unfairness Score (UScore), a novel metric designed to evaluate the unfairness of machine learning models in real-world IoE scenarios. We then extensively evaluate unfairness attacks using three IoE tabular datasets, demonstrating that AI model fairness can be compromised through data poisoning, whether in centralized learning (CL) or federated learning (FL) settings. Notably, such compromises can occur when malicious users tamper with only a small subset of the data they control. Finally, we propose a novel approach that unifies fairness and differential privacy (DP) by leveraging DP as a provable defense mechanism. This approach provides a universally applicable solution to unfairness attacks, regardless of whether the learning tasks are classification or regression, and is effective in both FL and CL settings. Our contributions represent a significant step in addressing unfairness and privacy concerns in AI-powered IoE systems.",

      "abstract": "We introduce the Condorcet attack, a new threat to fair transaction ordering. Specifically, the attack undermines batch-order-fairness, the strongest notion of transaction fair ordering proposed to date. The batch-order-fairness guarantees that a transaction tx is ordered before tx' if a majority of nodes in the system receive tx before tx'; the only exception (due to an impossibility result) is when tx and tx' fall into a so-called\"Condorcet cycle\". When this happens, tx and tx' along with other transactions within the cycle are placed in a batch, and any unfairness inside a batch is ignored. In the Condorcet attack, an adversary attempts to undermine the system's fairness by imposing Condorcet cycles to the system. In this work, we show that the adversary can indeed impose a Condorcet cycle by submitting as few as two otherwise legitimate transactions to the system. Remarkably, the adversary (e.g., a malicious client) can achieve this even when all the nodes in the system behave honestly. A notable feature of the attack is that it is capable of\"trapping\"transactions that do not naturally fall inside a cycle, i.e. those that are transmitted at significantly different times (with respect to the network latency). To mitigate the attack, we propose three methods based on three different complementary approaches. We show the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation methods through simulations, and explain their limitations.",

PoA has been widely adopted by communities and industries due to its better performance and faster finality. In this paper, we explore the unfairness issue existing in the current PoA implementations. We have investigated 2,500+ in the wild projects and selected 10+ as our main focus (covering Ethereum, Binance smart chain, etc.). We have identified two types of order manipulation attacks to separately break the transaction-level (a.k.a. transaction ordering) and the block-level (sealer position ordering) fairness. Both of them merely rely on honest-but-profitable sealer assumption without modifying original settings. We launch these attacks on the forked branches under an isolated environment and carefully evaluate the attacking scope towards different implementations. To date (as of Nov 2021), the potentially affected PoA market cap can reach up to 681,087 million USD. Besides, we further dive into the source code of selected projects, and accordingly, propose our recommendation for the fix. To the best of knowledge, this work provides the first exploration of the unfairness issue in PoA algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) software can lead to unfair and unethical decisions, thus fairness bugs in software are becoming a growing concern. Addressing these fairness bugs often involves sacrificing ML performance, such as accuracy. To address this issue, we present a novel counterfactual approach that uses counterfactual thinking to tackle the root causes of bias in ML software. In addition, our approach combines models optimized for both performance and fairness, resulting in an optimal solution in both aspects. We conducted a thorough evaluation of our approach on 10 benchmark tasks using a combination of 5 performance metrics, 3 fairness metrics, and 15 measurement scenarios, all applied to 8 real-world datasets. The conducted extensive evaluations show that the proposed method significantly improves the fairness of ML software while maintaining competitive performance, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in 84.6% of overall cases based on a recent benchmarking tool.",

      "abstract": "Ensuring fairness in algorithmic decision making is a crucial policy issue. Current legislation ensures fairness by barring algorithm designers from using demographic information in their decision making. As a result, to be legally compliant, the algorithms need to ensure equal treatment. However, in many cases, ensuring equal treatment leads to disparate impact particularly when there are differences among groups based on demographic classes. In response, several \u201cfair\u201d machine learning (ML) algorithms that require impact parity (e.g., equal opportunity) at the cost of equal treatment have recently been proposed to adjust for the societal inequalities. Advocates of fair ML propose changing the law to allow the use of protected class-specific decision rules. We show that the proposed fair ML algorithms that require impact parity, while conceptually appealing, can make everyone worse off, including the very class they aim to protect. Compared with the current law, which requires treatment parity, the fair ML algorithms, which require impact parity, limit the benefits of a more accurate algorithm for a firm. As a result, profit maximizing firms could underinvest in learning, that is, improving the accuracy of their machine learning algorithms. We show that the investment in learning decreases when misclassification is costly, which is exactly the case when greater accuracy is otherwise desired. Our paper highlights the importance of considering strategic behavior of stake holders when developing and evaluating fair ML algorithms. Overall, our results indicate that fair ML algorithms that require impact parity, if turned into law, may not be able to deliver some of the anticipated benefits.

      "abstract": "In recent years, many incidents have been reported where machine learning models exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc. Research has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine learning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build a pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed by a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a single classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the preprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed that often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather than the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness caused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In this paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the fairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged existing metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we conducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37 pipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain data transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a number of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers. Finally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in the global fairness of the pipeline. We used the fairness composition to choose appropriate downstream transformer that mitigates unfairness in the machine learning pipeline.",

      "abstract": "Future smart power distribution system with multiple active consumers and aggregators exchanging real-time electricity pricing and electricity consumption information over a communication network is prone to cyberattack. The goal of this paper is to understand the impact of attacks on pricing/load signals on the physical grid within a transactive energy market framework. First, this paper models the interaction between real-time electricity price and total energy demand in the form of a discrete time nonlinear autonomous dynamical system. Second, equilibrium electricity price and energy demand associated with this coupled dynamical system is derived and conditions for bounded input bounded output (BIBO) stability are identified. Third, a BIBO stable algorithm to design real-time electricity pricing scheme from a techno-economic perspective is developed. Finally, the impact of various levels of false data injection (FDI) attack on price of electricity, demand, and distribution system voltage is investigated. The proposed model is analyzed using simulations on the IEEE 69-bus test system and the impact of FDI attack on both electricity price/demand and distribution grid voltage is quantified. This paper shows that impact of FDI attack on electricity prices is more severe than an attack on electricity demand.",

The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is paramount in ensuring software supply chain security.

The executive order mandates that an SBOM must be provided for all software purchased by federal agencies. In this paper, we present an in-depth and systematic investigation of the trust that can be put into the output of SBOMs. Our research reveals that the SBOM generation process across popular programming languages is susceptible to stealthy manipulation by malicious insiders, leading to significant supply chain insecurities. We then investigated the tools used to consume SBOMs, examining their capability to detect and handle manipulated or compromised SBOM data. To address these security issues, we analyze the use of public repositories for software libraries to validate the integrity of dependencies and demonstrate the feasibility of our proof-of-concept implementation.

      "title": "Complexity Analysis of the SAT Attack on Logic Locking",
      "abstract": "Due to the adoption of horizontal business models following the globalization of semiconductor manufacturing, the overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs) and the piracy of intellectual properties (IPs) can lead to significant damage to the integrity of the semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking emerges as a primary design-for-security measure to counter these threats, where ICs become fully functional only when unlocked with a secret key. However, Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based attacks have rendered most locking schemes ineffective. This gives rise to numerous defenses and new locking methods to achieve SAT resiliency. This article provides a unique perspective on the SAT attack efficiency based on conjunctive normal form (CNF) stored in SAT solver. First, we show how the attack learns new relations between keys in every iteration using distinguishing input patterns and the corresponding oracle responses. The input-output pairs result in new CNF clauses of unknown keys to be appended to the SAT solver, which leads to an exponential reduction in incorrect key values. Second, we demonstrate that the SAT attack can break any locking scheme within linear iteration complexity of key size. Moreover, we show how key constraints on point functions affect the SAT attack complexity. We explain why proper key constraint on AntiSAT reduces the complexity effectively to constant 1. The same constraint helps the breaking of CAS-Lock down to linear iteration complexity. Our analysis provides a new perspective on the capabilities of SAT attack against multiplier benchmark c6288, and we provide new directions to achieve SAT resiliency.",

Such attacks can lead to system instability and, in the worst case, a blackout in the serviced area.

The proposed approach involves using Deep learning techniques for attack detection, utilizing time-series sensor data collected under various conditions, including load changes and normal operation. The RNN functions as a state observer, closely monitoring the output of converters and aligning with actual measurements. Through effective error estimation, the AI-based solution successfully identifies anomalies in local measurements. By integrating this error information, the attack detection system gains the capability to categorize the estimated error, indicating the presence of an attack on the system. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated using MATLAB, and realtime validation is conducted using OPAL-RT.",

      "title": "Blockchain security and applications: A comprehensive analysis from hash functions to consensus algorithms",
      "abstract": "This article delves into the inherent security of blockchain technology by evaluating the sophisticated techniques it employs. Key among these are mathematical hash functions, elliptic curve cryptography, and zero-knowledge proofs. Mathematical hash functions ensure that data stored is immutable; any slight alteration to the information will lead to a drastically different hash output, making any tampering evident. Elliptic curve cryptography provides a robust encryption mechanism, ensuring that data transactions remain confidential and secure. Meanwhile, zero-knowledge proofs enable one party to prove to another that they possess specific knowledge without revealing the actual information, further bolstering privacy. Owing to these technological underpinnings, blockchain not only excels in safeguarding sensitive data but also facilitates operations like verifying information authenticity. Moreover, in sectors like supply chain management, it offers capabilities for precise logistics positioning and traceability. Such applications underline blockchains potential as a tool for transparency and security in various industries. Through these features and mechanisms, blockchain stands as an exemplar of digital security in todays interconnected era.",

      "title": "Predicting Blockchain Application Performance with Machine Learning Techniques",
      "abstract": "Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger designed to record all transactions within its network, characterized by its decentralized nature, resistance to tampering, and attributes such as consistency, anonymity, and traceability. However, evaluating blockchain applications' performance can be complex due to their intricate and distributed infrastructure. This research employs machine learning model-based methods to predict blockchain systems' performance using predetermined configuration parameters. The data used in this study is derived from a blockchain simulator, generating blockchain data to facilitate performance predictions. The simulation process involves using simulated data and configuration settings for each run, including parameters such as the number of nodes, the number of miners, consensus algorithm, maximum block size, and transaction quantities, among others. Output metrics such as the total number of blocks, transaction rate, block propagation time, and latency are utilized to assess network performance. The simulator was run 184 times with various configurations. Our findings indicate that the Random Forest model outperformed other models used in the experiments, achieving the highest R\u00b2 scores for multiple metrics, such as 0.987 for total number of transactions and 0.765 for average block propagation time, while also demonstrating lower RMSE values, indicating more accurate predictions.",

      "title": "Anti-Corruption Disclosure Prediction Using Deep Learning",
      "abstract": "Corruption gives major problem to many countries. It gives negative impact to a nation economy. People also realized that corruption comes from two sides, demand from the authority and supply from corporate. On that regard, corporates may have their part in fight against corruption in the form of anti- corruption disclosure (ACD). This study proposes new method of ACD prediction in corporate using deep learning. The data in this study are taken from every companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from the year 2017 to 2019. The companies can be categorized in 9 categories and the data set has 8 features. The overall data has 1826 items in which 1032 items are ACD and the other 794 items are non-ACD. In this study, the deep neural network or deep learning is composed from input layer, output layer and 3 hidden layers. The deep neural network uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0010, batch size 16 and epochs 500. The drop out is set to 0.05. The accuracy result from deep learning in predicting ACD is considered good with the average training accuracy is 74.76% and average testing accuracy is 76.37%. However, the loss result isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good with average training loss and testing loss are respectively 51.76% and 50.96%. Since the aim of the study to find the possibility of deep learning as alternative of logistic regression in ACD prediction, accuracy comparison from deep learning and logistic regression is held. Deep learning has average prediction accuracy of 76.37% is better than logistic regression with average accuracy of 67.15%. Deep learning also has higher minimum accuracy and maximum accuracy compared to logistic regression. This study concludes that deep learning may give alternatives in ACD prediction compared the more common method of logistic regression.",

      "title": "Predicting Developers' IDE Commands with Machine Learning",
      "abstract": "When a developer is writing code they are usually focused and in a state-of-mind which some refer to as flow. Breaking out of this flow can cause the developer to lose their train of thought and have to start their thought process from the beginning. This loss of thought can be caused by interruptions and sometimes slow IDE interactions. Predictive functionality has been harnessed in user applications to speed up load times, such as in Google Chrome's browser which has a feature called \"Predicting Network Actions\". This will pre-load web-pages that the user is most likely to click through. This mitigates the interruption that load times can introduce. In this paper we seek to make the first step towards predicting user commands in the IDE. Using the MSR 2018 Challenge Data of over 3000 developer session and over 10 million recorded events, we analyze and cleanse the data to be parsed into event series, which can then be used to train a variety of machine learning models, including a neural network, to predict user induced commands. Our highest performing model is able to obtain a 5 cross-fold validation prediction accuracy of 64%.",
